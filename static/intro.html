        <h3>From Art to Data: <i>WRITE - WenDAng Digital Archive</i></h3>
        <p>The ERC Starting Grant project called <a href="https://writecalligraphyproject.eu/" target="_blank"> <b>WRITE</b> ‚Äì New Forms of Calligraphy in China: A Contemporary Culture Mirror</a> ‚Äì is a major research initiative that explores how evolving forms of calligraphy in contemporary China are reshaping cultural identity.
          With a growing presence in the contemporary arts, <b>WRITE</b> systematically analyzes these transformations as both artistic expressions and cultural phenomena.
        </p>
        <p>Building on the extensive research conducted by <b>WRITE</b>, the <strong>WenDAng project</strong> aims to create the first open-access semantic digital archive dedicated to these emerging forms of Chinese calligraphy.
          <b>WenDAng</b> can be interpreted as the digital extension of <b>WRITE</b>, using its heterogeneous data collected through the research to offer a centralized platform for conservation, exploration, analysis, and public engagement.
        </p>
        <p> The <b>WenDAng</b> project, grounded in Digital Humanities, leverages computational tools to preserve, analyse, represent, and visualise the findings gathered from the WRITE project.
          It does so while maintaining a critical awareness of the cultural significance of the objects studied. This methodology not only provides fresh perspectives on contemporary calligraphy but also redefines how knowledge about it is generated and disseminated.
          At the core of this effort is the <b>WRITE ontology</b>, a framework that is still being developed and refined, that allows for the representation of both tangible and intangible aspects of this important cultural, artistic, linguistic, and social phenomenon.
          The ontology, together with a dedicated <b>thesaurus</b>, will help bridging the gap in representation of traditional and contemporary expressions of calligraphy and art. By following Linked Open Data and FAIR principles, this work enables robust analysis and fosters the creation of new knowledge from three key perspectives: 
        </p>
        <div class="analysis-list">
        <ul>
        <li><p><i>Artistic analysis</i>: A detailed examination of the artworks from formal, stylistic, and iconographic perspectives.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><i>Linguistic / textual analysis</i>: An in-depth analysis of the texts within the artworks, including transcription, language identification, authorship, genre, meaning, textual history, and translation.
        </p></li> 
        <li><p><i>Socio-political-economic analysis</i>: A comprehensive evaluation of the artwork's context, including its patronage (public or private), public reception, exhibition history, and economic value.
        </p></li> 
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>The WRITE Digital Archive will ensure data interoperability, seamless accessibility, and the ability to perform integrated queries across artistic, linguistic, and socio-political dimensions, making it a groundbreaking resource for both researchers and the broader public.

          <h4>The gist of it all</h4>
        <p>
          In the very core of <b>WRITE</b>, and thus consecutively of <b>WenDAng</b>, are the <strong>four types of art</strong>, referred to as <code>collections</code> within the WRITE knowledge base. These collections serve as the organisational foundation for the digital archive. 
          The archive distinguishes another precious element essential for representing and analysing Chinese contemporary calligraphy - the so-called <b>"Calli-Writing" unit</b> - which is a segment of the artwork that contains any kind of writing and / or calligraphy.</p>
        <p>The 4 collections of art are the following:
