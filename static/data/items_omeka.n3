    ns3:description """"Drink Alone Under the Moon, Raise a Wine Glass to Ask the Sky by Li Bai" (Li Bai "Yue xia duzhuo" & "Ba jiu wen tian" 李白《月下独酌》,《把酒问天》) is an installation work realized in 2019 by Wang Dongling . The artist used bright red acrylic on a six-fold screen of gold leaf to write two poems of Li Bai 李白 (701-762), namely "Drinking alone under the Moon (Yue xia duzhuo 月下独酌) and “Raise a Wine Glass to Ask the Sky" (Ba jiu wen tian 把酒问天) using his Entangled Script (luanshu 乱书) on a golden leaf screen of 1.7 meters high and 3.6 meters long. The screen is slightly folded and stands on a stainless steel plate of 1 meter wide and 4 meters long, so that the golden screen and the red writings reflect in it, mirroring and integrating  the viewers into the work in a continuosly changing dialogue with the artwork.
Wang Dongling used the same  two poems by Li Bai in 2016 when he realized a previous  hanging scroll with black ink on white paper, measuring  275cm×1870cm."""@en ;

In this series, the artist combines the traditional aesthetics of Chinese garments, like qipao (traditional Chinese dresses) and hanfu (traditional Han Chinese clothing) and characters written with with his signature ink painting techniques, made up of ink, cigarettes and incense stick. 
Wang developed this method of “writing” after he accidentally dropped ash onto paper while lighting a cigarette in his studio and observed the resulting perforations. For him, the process resembles that of “burning” information onto digital drives—hence the title of the series. Wang’s layering of ink and paper obscures the individual characters, yet the vivid physical traces of the artist’s hand assert the primacy of the creative process and the object’s materiality, reminding us that much of Chinese culture is preserved through a medium that is inherently fragile and vulnerable, and that our grasp of past traditions is similarly elusive.

    ns3:description """This artwork was made during the Simple Urban Plus Festival, a music and art festival dedicated to young people, which took place on November 2-3, 2019 at the Chengdu Tianfu Furong Garden.
This artwork is composed of four characters (fu lu shou xi 福禄壽禧). These four characters form a popular auspicious phrase that means "Good fortune, long life and happiness".  Each character is placed on a single panel; the four panels are next to one another, and the four characters are read from right to left as usual in traditional Chinese calligraphy. In this work, Fan Sack was probably inspired by the big signs written from right to left in Chinese calligraphy  on temples or public buildings.
The artwork is made exactly like a calligraphy: (1) its format recalls the "big character calligraphy" (dazi shufa 大字书法) of classical tradition; (2) the artist seeks to reproduce brush strokes on paper using a paint roller and a brush; (3) the calligraphic script seems to reproduce regular script (kaishu 楷书), and the links between certain strokes of the characters recall running script (xingshu 行书).
In contrast to traditional calligraphy, which is always monochrome (black ink on white paper), in this work each character is painted a different colour and has a colourful kaleidoscopic circle in the background that gives tridimensionality and power to each character."""@en ;

This artwork provides an example of his interactive piece made of a disassemblable and reassemblable puzzle consisting of 2700 wooden blocks, onto which Chen transcribed the the most undisputed classic in the history of Chinese calligraphy,  the 'Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Gathering', written by Wang Xizhi in 353. This reinvention and reinterpretation  in a modern context of Wang Xizhi's famous piece transforms the artwork into an interactive game that captivates the audience, notably the Western audience (as the exhibition is held in Berlin). It serves as an introduction to the contemplation and manipulation of the calligraphic line, challenging viewers to reconstruct its unity without prior knowledge of the underlying meaning or the writing that inspired it (Iezzi 2014, p. 440).

    ns3:description """"Four Books and Five Classics (Si Shu Wu Jing 四书五经)" created by Chen Guangwu in 2008, involved a unique artistic process. Chen first wrote the contents of the books with ink on paper. Then, he macerated all the xuan paper with the text in a basin of water, making paper pulp, made of the fibers of paper, this process is tipically used to recycle paper or other materials. The process of making paper pulp involves breaking down the raw materials into small fibers, which are then mixed with water to form a slurry. 
The process of making paper pulp begins with breaking down raw materials into small fibers, which are then mixed with water to create a slurry. This slurry undergoes further processing to eliminate water and impurities, resulting in a uniform mixture. Usually, the pulp is spread out and dried to form new sheets of paper, but in Chen's approach, he manipulates the black slurp to resemble a paper sculpture in the shape of the original books. The paper obvioulsy differs significantly with textures, thicknesses, and qualities of paper that differ significantly from the originals. Through  these meticulous techniques, Chen dissolve the texts into sculptures of paper pulps, exploring themes of cultural transformation and loss, and he offers a unique perspective on a culture he believes is eroding.
The Four Books (四书) and the Five Classics (五经) refer to the Confucian classics, essential texts in Confucianism that cover a wide range of topics such as ethics, governance, and philosophy. The Four Books are Chinese classic texts selected by Zhu Xi in the Song dynasty, as an introduction to Confucianism. They include the Great Learning (Da Xue 大学), The Analects of Confucius (Lunyu 论语), The Doctrine of the Mean (Zhongyong 中庸), and the Mencius (Mengzi 孟子).
The Five Classics is a corpus of five ancient Chinese books used by Confucianism as the basis of studies. According to tradition, they were compiled or edited by Confucius himself. They are: Classic of Changes (Yijing 易经), Classic of Poetry (Shijing 诗经), Book of Rites (Liji 礼记), Book of Documents (Shujing 书经) and Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu 春秋)."""@en ;

    ns3:description "Wang Nanming was swayed by the arguments put forth by the French philosopher and critic Jacques Derrida, who advocated for the complete deconstruction and reassembly of conventional structures. Wang Nanming swiftly recognized that his habit of rejecting paper accumulated during his calligraphy practice into tight balls whenever dissatisfied with his work symbolized the myriad contradictions in calligraphy itself. Viewing these discarded paper balls as emblematic of the negative aspects of Chinese culture, Wang found in them a perfect graphic representation. His act of crumpling and discarding sheets of work became a demonstration of his rejection. Wang Nanming began transforming his Balls of Characters (Ziqiu 字球) into combinations (Combination: Balls of Characters, Ziqiu zuhe 字球组合; 1992) and into various objects such as chairs, sofas, and tables. This artistic evolution served as his protest against what he perceived as the shallow mass culture prevailing in modern China."@en ;

It is based on the logic of video games and the aesthetics of calligraphy, accompanied by musical background, in the first part with traditional Chinese instruments, in the second part with the electronic music  by New Pants (Xin kuzi yuedui 新裤子乐队), a Chinese indie rock band. The title "Not Too Late" is  also inspired by a song of the same name by Hua Dong of the New Pants.
The installation (video screen) was created by the V&A Museum for the exhibition Decode, which took place at CAFA Museum, Beijing, in 2010, and the artwork has since been presented in numerous other exhibitions. Not Too Late represents Feng Mengbo's first calligraphy-related artwork. Feng Mengbo was inspired by calligraphy and Jackson Pollock's action paintings. Feng Mengbo, following Q4U (2002), creates another personalized version of the highly popular and violent internet video game of Quake 3 Arena (1999) to portray his experiences and opinions about the timeliness of calligraphy with the 3D realization of  calligraphy movements.

    ns3:description """The artwork "Entire World Celebrates (Putian tong qing 普天同庆)" was the Kwanyin Clan’s most successful experiment with distinctly Chinese yet modernised elements in a work commissioned by a foreign brand. It depicts a football fully hand-painted with tempera and marker, made on commission for Adidas for the 2010 FIFA World Cup advertising campaign. Yumi and Nat, the creators of the piece, covered the entire surface of the ball with traditional Chinese motifs, reworked in very personal ways. A curved line divides the ball into two parts and recreates the Taijitu 太极图, the Taoist symbol par excellence, consisting of the stylized shape of a black and a white fish, intertwining in a whirling embrace. It represents the concept of the Tao (Dao 道), the source of being that regulates the development of the universe through the alternation of two complementary elements: yin 阴, the dark-negative polarity represented by the black fish, and yang 阳, the light-positive polarity represented by the white fish. 
The two sections of the ball are filled with opposing motifs: one recalls the Euro-American graffiti tradition and the other the traditional Chinese culture, and these intertwine just like Yin and Yang, in a perfect fusion. On one side, Yumi creates an extreme grey and white wildstyle, while on the other, on a red background, Nat draws the zoomorphic image of the taotie 饕餮, an archaic decorative motif typical of ritual bronzes from the Shang (c. 1600-1046 BC) and Zhou (1046-221 BC) dynasties, representing a frontal, symmetrical mask with various parts of different animals. Since, in the Chinese tradition, football – or cuju 蹴鞠 – evoked a Zen meditative act, we instinctively thought of the image of the Taijitu, consisting of the stylised form of two fish, one white and one black, intertwining with each other, surrounded by the Eight Trigrams. This design formed the basis of the work, to which we then added the zoomorphic image of the taotie, which is a traditional Chinese decorative motif I am particularly fond of. Interestingly, this work is intended to recall the ancient Chinese game of football, cuju (lit. kicking a leather ball). According to FIFA, cuju is the earliest attested form of football in the world, and its invention dates from the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). Initially, it was slightly different from the modern game: there were six holes on each side of the pitch with six goalkeepers, and each team, composed of six players plus the goalkeepers, had to score the highest number of goals. In the Tang dynasty, the holes turned into two goals on opposite sides of the field and the game resembled the current one. The Eight Trigrams are figures composed of three parallel lines, surrounding the Taijitu with a perfect octagon, each aligned to a cardinal point. The lines can be continuous or broken, indicating positive (yang) or negative (yin) polarity respectively. Each trigram corresponds to a natural element or phenomenon (sky, swamp, fire, thunder, wind, water, mountain and earth), and all together they symbolize the contents of the Book of Changes (Yijing), one of the fundamental texts of traditional Chinese knowledge. The wildstyle within one of the two sections of the ball recalls the linearity of the trigrams. Reference to the World Cup in the image is evident: the two sections of the Taijitu ideally represent the two football teams (the yin and the yang) that share and mix on the same pitch (the circle), thus generating a continuous action (the Tao)."""@en ;

    ns3:description """With the artworks Heqi 和气 (Peace), the Kwanyin Clan creates a modern version of the iconic blue and white Chinese porcelain, combining a traditional type of art with contemporary graffiti writing techniques. 
From 2009 to 2010, the Kwanyin Clan experiments with the use of innovative media a series dedicated to blue and white porcelain. The crew transposes graffiti art styles and techniques onto artefacts of diverse and extremely unique shapes (plates, vases and brush pots) through traditional cobalt blue decorations.
For instance, in the piece Heqi 和气 (Peace), Nat used a blue marker to write, in wildstyle, the two characters of the title "Heqi 和气" on a white porcelain plate, with arrows and zigzagging lines that perfectly combine a traditional approach with contemporary execution. 
For the Kwanyin Clan using Chinese characters in graffiti form as decorative motifs for porcelain artefacts means experimenting with new patterns of decoration. Since the motifs used in porcelain are rather standardized and most of them are not compatible with today’s aesthetic models, they tried to create new ones. It was simply a matter of changing the support material for the writing piece: resorting to porcelain added a further oriental and traditional touch to their style, which, however, remains unchanged. In this specific case, the choice of Heqi 和气 characters stemmed from the fact that decorative motifs in Chinese artistic handicrafts are always linked to auspicious and good luck messages, so they chose to focus the piece on these two characters. Indeed, they are indeed present in a chengyu used as a wish of happiness, which reads Heqi shengcai 和气生财 (Amiability begets riches).
The Chinese elements in this work are numerous: blue and white porcelain, Chinese characters, the chengyu inspiration for the title, its auspicious meaning, the decorative “clouds pattern” (yunwen), and the motif of the “turbulent ocean waves” (ping shui) within the central part, all transposed in a modern key. This series is one of the preeminent examples of the Kwanyin Clan experimental power expressed by reworking traditional patterns. """@en ;

    ns3:description "This artwork was made by the Kwanyin Clan for the exhibition \"Street Art, a Global View\" (The History of Street Art - from New York to Beijing) held in 2016 from 1 July to 24 August at the CAFA Art Museum (Art Museum of the Central Academy of Fine Arts) in Beijing. The exhibition was the first opportunity to showcase pieces by foreign street artists in China, generating both a geographical and temporal comparison of the street art phenomenon in its globality (Danysz 2016). The Kwanyin Clan was one of the few Chinese crews invited to participate in the event, proving the group's fundamental importance within the art scene in mainland China and abroad. The work they produced for the occasion fits perfectly into their framework of research, with a reference to porcelain (Chinese pottery), an art for which China has been renowned worldwide for centuries. The core of the composition is a green celadon glazed ceramic vase (a ceramic vase glazed in jade green celadon color). This recalls the Jun-type celadons made in China during the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279), considered one of the finest forms of Chinese art and that are one of the most beautiful ceramic ware of all time and were particularly appreciated among the Chinese literati. The explosive force of the elaborate wildstyle charactering piece \"guanyin 观音\" pushes onto the thin walls of the vase and disintegrates it, representing the forces of modernity that break and overcomes tradition. In the lower right-hand corner, there are a semi-cursive / running style (xingshu 行书) calligraphic inscription consisting of two chengyu on vertical columns serves as a double warning. As usual in \"traditional colophon\", next to the calligraphic inscription there is a real seal with the name of the crew, but opposite to the traditional canons, the seal is in Latin letters and not in archaic characters. The first chengyu states that \"observing a person's failings you know what he really is\" (guanguozhiren 观过知仁), while the second affirms that \"when we receive positive influences, we can change our old habits\" (panlingeyin 泮林革音). These two chengyu seem to be personal and artistic admonishments made by the crew. i) With regard to the personal sphere, the smashed vase represents the person's faults and failing: when the person's thin 'glaze' is smashed, one can show his real nature and change his old habits. ii) With regard to the artistic sphere, the content of the vase represents the real nature of the Kwanyin Clan's art (graffiti), while the traditional art is only its cover (the glaze of the vase): when the power of graffiti smashes that cover, the traditional influences will be transformed into modern art."@en ;

    ns3:description """This artwork was made by EricTin and NaTuo, and it took three days to complete it. The piece entitled New Style relates to bamboo painting (zhuhua 竹 画), a type of art that has always played a leading role in China, being second only to landscape painting. In painting bamboos, which represent the scenic backdrop of the work, EricTin and Natuo, the authors of the piece, were strongly influenced by traditional canons that tend to emphasise “the lithe grace of its stalk and the dashing sword-point of its leaves” (Sullivan 1967, p. 215). The bamboo was in fact the favorite natural subject for the proud and independent Chinese literati. To them, indeed, the bamboo was itself a symbol of the true gentleman (junzi 君子), pliant yet strong, who maintains his integrity unsullied no matter how low the adverse winds of circumstance may bend him. The light grace of its stalk and the dashing swordpoint of its leaves offered the perfect subject to his brush. Even if in drawing bamboo EricTin and NaTuo have been strongly influenced by traditional canons, they do not follow traditional standards in the compositional arrangement. The bamboos do not, however, constitute the core of the composition, as one would expect, but are replaced in their pre-eminent function by a lettering piece placed at the center: bamboos are only the scenic backdrop that frames the main subject. Still, there is a significant correspondence between the lettering piece and the bamboos in the background: the shades of green used for the lettering are the same as the bamboos; the four interlocking letters KYGS (the acronym for KwanYin Graffiti Studio) are reproduced through extreme (almost indecipherable) wildstyle and numerous 3D effects, with the sole intention of reproducing the knottiness of the bamboos; the sphere has the same colours as the thin stems sprouting from the letters, resembling the stylised foliage of the bamboos immersed in a thick mist. The interlocking letters involved in the piece are KYGS (KwanYin Graffiti Studio) and also their colors (from light green to very dark green) are very similar to bamboos. Furthermore, at the center of the piece, EricTin inserted a yellow sphere with the traditional character Guan (the first character of Guanyin), a recurring element in his pieces. The sphere has the same colors as the ones of thin pinnacles sprouting from the green letters: they seem to replicate the stylized "foliage" of the bamboos. So even if the lettering piece in the foreground is much more important than the bamboos in the background, similarities between these two elements tend to merge them into a single entity. The use of green color helps to create this unity but it is very unusual in this kind of painting. In traditional bamboo paintings, in fact, the artists always used monochrome ink in order to shape an "ink bamboo painting" (mozhuhua 墨竹画). The use of monochrome ink in this king of painting is crucial because it "brought the painter closest to that most difficult of arts, calligraphy".
In New Style, the use of green recalls another artistic tradition, not Chinese but Western, the tradition of Western realism, based on a steadfast devotion to color truth. The colours (various shades of green) and the angularity of the central writing also recall the greenish patina and the typical protruding and richly worked surface of ancient Chinese ritual bronze vessels (qingtongqi 青铜器), which, as EricTin explains in his blog, are the real source of inspiration for the piece. This is evident not only in the choice of colors, but also in the "angularity" of the lettering piece "patterned with ridges" that replaces the typical ribbed surface of bronze vessels. The presence of mist is another reference to traditional Chinese painting. The mist usually never fails in Chinese paintings, but here: i) it is painted in white color and without leaving empty spaces as usually happens in traditional artworks; and ii) it hides the awkward junctures of bamboo, the opposite of what used to happen in painting bamboo where "the awkward junctures of bamboo cannot be hid in mist as in landscape painting". The format of the work, reminiscent of both Chinese handscroll papers (or large album leaf, one of the main format of Chinese painting) and big western canvases (the typical support of Western art, especially if you see the work from a long distance), and the use of both letters and characters, represent points of contact between the Chinese and western traditions. In fact, in the bottom left-hand corner, the name of the two authors (EricTin and NaTuo) and of the crew (Kwanyin) are written horizontally in Latin letters and the year of the execution (2008) is reported in Arabic numbers; while vertical Chinese characters are used in the top left-hand corner for the group’s tag (Guanyin 觀音), inside the yellow sphere at the centre (Guan 觀), and finally on the right edge in the calligraphic inscription. 
The use of Chinese characters is also reiterated in the calligraphic inscription on the right side of the work and displayed in two vertical columns to be read from right to left and from top to bottom. The inscription is written in xingcao 行草 style, a style of handwriting between the running (xing 行) hand and the cursive (cao 草) hand. 
The content of the calligraphy is a couplet: "Buried in the earth it already has a culm, reaching into the sky it is still open-minded". The two lines quoted by EricTin are from a poem entitled "On Bamboo" (Zhu 竹). The author of this poem is Zheng Xie 郑燮 (1693-1765), commonly known by his pseudonym as Zheng Banqiao 郑板桥, a famous poet, painter and calligrapher of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) who was particularly skilled at drawing bamboos combining painting and calligraphy. The short poem is a hymn to the qualities of the perfect gentleman (jun zi 君子), of whom the bamboo has always been the personification. The modesty, honesty, uprightness and open-mindedness of the perfect Chinese gentleman are expressed by the straightness, flexibility and malleability of bamboo, its ability to resist the elements, bend and never break, and its “hollow structure” (xu xin 虚心, lit. empty heart). In the Chinese philo sophical meaning, such hollowness is the absence of ties and desires, and thus indicates inner peace and humility; the readiness of mind needed to understand the world, without constraint and according to the principle of spontaneity (Illouz 1989, p. 57). The purpose of using Zheng Xie’s poem is to create an ideal connection between the ancient Chinese literati – the perfect gentlemen – and contemporary graffiti writers, here represented by the members of the Kwanyin Clan. According to the content of this poem, in his paintings, the bamboo trunks, stems and leaves are usually lean but strong, so embodying the playfulness and spontaneity of a "man of letters". The couplet by Zheng Xie is paraphrased from the third and fourth lines of another poem composed by the Song poet Xu Tingyun 徐庭筠 (1095-1179) entitled "Ode to Bamboo" (Yong zhu 咏竹).  Even if there are also some little differences among the three versions of the couplet, all of them focus on the qualities of the perfect literati (junzi) symbolised by the bamboo. The bamboo, in fact, grows straightly and keeps green in winter (wei chutu qian xian you jie 未出土前先有节), which is an indication of its firm and tenacious character; it is hollow inside (wu xin 无心 "without a core"), so it is regarded as "honest and upright" (xu xin 虚心); and even in winter, its leaves rustle in the wind, "reaching the clouds" (lingyun 凌云), while it still stands straight on its deep roots (shenchu zong 深处总), symbolising great modesty (xu xin). The depiction of the bamboos and the transcription of the couplet are two expedients to create a connection between the ancient Chinese literati-painters, who were used to painting bamboo and composing poems on his gentleman qualities, and the contemporary Chinese graffiti writers (such as EricTin and Natuo), who can do exactly the same things (as demonstrated in New Style), but using different modern tools (spray painting on wall). Viewed in this light, also the chain of citations triggered by the couplet is another erudite device to link the past to the present. In this work, the link to the past tradition is also underlined by the simultaneous use of painting, calligraphy, and poetry, the so-called "three perfections" (sanjue). 
In the past, bamboo painters were accustomed to i) inscribing a poem that accompanied the painting and further elucidated its motif; ii) shaping calligraphy and painting with the same brushstrokes; and iii) reflecting in calligraphy similar moods and states of awareness expressed in poetry. According to this past tradition, in New Style: i) the content of the poem referred to the symbolic meaning of the painted bamboo; ii) both calligraphic inscription and lettering piece are shaped with entangled lines, and because of their complex styles (cursive style and wildstyle, respectively), they are equally incomprehensible; iii) the vertical columns of the calligraphy and its cursive "brushstrokes" respectively reproduce the straight stalk of the bamboo and the dashing sword point of its leaves described in the poem. So, here the traditional triad of poetry, calligraphy and painting was perfectly recomposed in a contemporary framework, using a "new style", as it has been declared in the work’s title."""@en ;

    ns3:description "This artwork was created for the 2008 Olympic Games near the Beijing Institute of Technology as part of the Beijing Olympic Cultural Wall Creative Design Campaign. This campaign was sponsored by the Beijing Olympic Committee, the Beijing City 2008 Environmental Headquarters Office, and the Beijing People’s Broadcasting Station, with the aim of stimulating the creativity of artists in bringing further prestige to the international event and getting citizens to actively contribute to its success. Such mass involvement in artistic production is a distinctive feature of communist propaganda (Lu 2015, pp. 49-50). As is often the case with Chinese crews, the Kwanyin Clan has regularly collaborated with the local Chinese government, to embellish the urban fabric of Beijing and create “visual propaganda” works (Valjakka 2015, pp. 258- 259) to promote the image of a rich, prosperous, long-standing China. In Olympic Beijing we find a number of typically Chinese elements representing the country’s past and present greatness (calligraphic inscriptions, bamboo, pagodas, a table-tennis player, traditional cloud and wave motifs), with explicit references to the Beijing Olympics (the central lettering ‘Beijing Olympics’, the Olympic torch, the stylized little man logo and the Fuwa mascot), and all accentuated by extensive use of China’s hallmark red, recalling a modern-day nationalist propaganda poster."@en ;

    ns3:description "This is a Li Qiuqiu recent artwork produced in 2020 with Corw, depicting the expression Qingwu tuya 请勿涂鸦 (No graffiti, please). The piece has a distinctly political orientation as it was created on Jingmi Road, Beijing's most important hall of fame for some time now, and once home - as Li Qiuqiu himself says - to numerous graffiti. Later, these were all buffed by the government and replaced by a long, grey and anonymous wall dotted with the black stencil inscriptions Qingwu tuya 请勿涂鸦 \"No graffiti\" posted by the government itself. As an act of protest, Li Qiuqiu and Corw decided to paint graffiti with the same text, but using bright colours and fun animations so as to brighten the blank wall that had once been the heart of a shared creativity. As a result of this act of artistic rebellion, many other writers followed suit, once more filling the wall with graffiti: a fine example of a peaceful protest with spray cans. "@en ;

    ns2:title "Shehui (社会)" ;
    ns3:description "In this artwork, Li Qiuqiu painted the head of a black man on the left, his tag 0528 in the middle, and the two characters of his brand Shehui 社会 (Society) on the left. The character depicted is typical of the initial stage of his career, when he used to draw enormous heads of men with half-closed eyes, full lips, a snub nose, sometimes with sunglasses and a bald head or with the features of a man of colour. The style is always caricature-like, and the idea behind these big heads probably comes from the giant profiles used by Zhang Dali in his series “Dialogue and Demolition”. Li Qiuqiu himself admits that Zhang Dali was somehow an influence for his art (Valjakka 2016, p. 361), together with other street artists like Banksy, Bonzai, Hobey, Kobra and Chinaman (Li 2016). As for the structure of this work, we can see the tag 0528 in the middle, rendered in 3D style with blue and light blue double depths and no fill-in. The tag is stroked by the large hand of the curly-haired character on the left, introducing a sense of continuity between these two elements. The colouring and the sinuous progression of the writing evoke sea waves, and the drips under the number recall an aquatic atmosphere. It is not by chance that the two Chinese characters on the right stand out on a background of blue bubbles, the same colour as the writing: the fill-in is light blue, the outline is white, and the depths are blue. The work was created in Wudaokou, one of the most international and graffiti-rich neighborhoods in Beijing, on the enclosing walls of a residential area that isolate it from the rest of the neighborhood, like a ghetto markedly separating the wealthy from the rest of the population. The place was not chosen randomly, but obviously hides an underlying social criticism. The writing style used for the Chinese characters is geometric and reminiscent of “regular script” (kaishu 楷书), an easily intelligible calligraphic style where each stroke is distinct and discernible. We can find an evolution of this geometric style in works like Bie feihua 别 废话 (No superfluous words, 2006), whose lines reveal the influence of the graphic style used in the tagging-up and of the bubble style used in works like Penzi’er 喷子儿 (2005). Compared to Shehui 社会 of 2005, in works like Bie feihua or others created slightly later some of the strokes are rounded and appear more fluid-like, without however losing their geometric shape completely. This leads to Li Qiuqiu’s writing style, in which the strokes are sometimes rounded, sometimes orthogonal, in a skilful interplay of delicate balances. The background is a tangle of bubbles, waves are depicted within the characters (in the central section). All elements that, again, are reminiscent of aquatic settings. Thus, through the marine atmosphere, Li Qiuqiu seems to disclose a world in which everything – waves, bubbles, architecture, walls, street art – is fluid and fleeting, while also granting a touch of liveliness to the composition, as we occasionally find in his graffiti.

    ns3:chinese-visual-element "Green" ;
    ns3:description "This is the most famous artwork among the crew’s commercial pieces and it was created in 2007 for Nike. At the time of its creation, it was the tallest graffiti piece in China: 10 meters high and 3.15 meters wide. It took Soos, 0528 and More two days to complete, and they only employed spray cans for its creation. Here we find an inscription in Chinese characters, together with a figure with Chinese somatic features and traditional Chinese decorative architectural elements. The work is thus close to a manifesto of the search for “Chineseness” that the crew’s works strive for. The inscription in Chinese characters can be found in the top section of the piece and stands as its title: Wo de lanqiu you jietou dazao 我的篮球由街头打造 (My way of playing basketball is born in the street). It recalls the underground street culture of New York’s inner city and of Chinese cities, where playing basketball is a way to hang out with friends. The inscription sets out to connect the place where graffiti art was born, the USA, to the place where it is now developing, China, while obviously referencing the sport that is the subject of the commercial advertising requested by Nike. The characters are written in 3D style, the fill-in color is red with beige inlays, decorations and underlines, and the outline is white with dark green depths. This triumph of colors and decorations underlines the sense of light-heartedness with which the piece is imbued. The writing style is rounded and playful, calling to mind the idea of leisure associated with the theme of the graffiti. In the lower part of the piece, a puppet represents a basketball player intent on juggling the ball in the street. He is wearing a pair of dark glasses and a cap slung backwards, which make us think of an outdoor game. His hip-hop look seems to bring him very close to the creators of the piece, but the extremely large hands with which he catches the ball, on which the Nike logo is clearly visible, are a good reminder of the purpose of the work and its commissioner. The outdoor setting is also highlighted by the purple background, over which the player stands out. The skyline is an ancient Chinese city with pagoda roofs and a temple in the middle, a distinctive element of the work of 0528. The whole piece is executed in a very captivating cartoon style. The graffiti is framed by a vine full of yellow buds, which is a recurring element in Soos’ works and his second signature. Inside one of these buds, right in the center of the work, stands the inscription “Nike” and, below it, the three tags of the authors of the piece (0528, Soos and More) and that of BJPZ. The piece was created on a panel installed on the outside wall of a Yaxin shop selling branded Nike products in China. The shop is located in Dongsi, in the city center near the Forbidden City, and represents one of the sanctuaries of sportswear in the capital. Right beside the shop stands a KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), the American fast-food chain restaurant specialized in fried chicken, which is very popular in China. Although some might disapprove of it, the location chosen by BJPZ is an emblem of the American-style Chinese consumerism typical of our times. Graffiti, born to fight this kind of inequality-generating society, here integrates to perfection with the surroundings, even becoming an unexpected catalyzer and promoter of a hyper-consumerist and disengaged society. There appears to be an inherent contradiction; so why? What lies behind the need to make such graffiti? When the crew is asked why they commit to this kind of commercial activity, they answer that this is the only way to earn money to be reinvested on the streets. The crew uses their earnings to buy spray cans for their favorite activity: bombing the streets of Beijing at night."@en ;

    ns2:title "R.I.P. 512 Sichuan Earthquake" ;
    ns3:chinese-concept "Chinese red" ;
    ns3:description "In 2008, the Beijing Penzi crew created the artwork entitled “R.I.P. 512 Sichuan Earthquake” in memory of the Sichuan earthquake victims. It was painted on one of the outer fencing walls of Renmin University, one of the most important halls of fame in Beijing, by Soos, 0528 and More, to commemorate the victims of the devastating earthquake which occurred in the Sichuan region (north-western China) on 12 May 2008, causing around 70,000 deaths. The acronym R.I.P. in the title of the work means “Rest in Peace”, a farewell from the crew to those who died in the tragedy. The work is composed of a portion with Chinese characters on the left, in which a chengyu (a four-character idiomatic phrase) reads Zhongzhichengcheng 众 支（志）成城 (Unity is Strength). This is an incitement not to be discouraged even in the darkest moments, but to work together to face the immense catastrophe and find the strength to recover. The four characters composing the chengyu fade from red to yellow on a black background, and their style resembles the running or semi-cursive script (xingshu 行书) used in Chinese calligraphy, in which the character strokes are joined together by a single quick stenographic stroke. Its thickness varies constantly, its shapes are rounded, and the beginnings of lines are evident and allow the public to mentally retrace the agitated rhythm of this spray “brushstroke”. Altogether it reproduces the upheaval and brutality of the event. The gestures and poses of the figures portrayed next to the written portion echo the agitation of such moments. To the immediate left, three rescuers from the National Rescue Team, wearing red jackets and helmets, work tirelessly to remove the rubble with their bare hands, trying to save a little girl from the wreckage. The expression on the child’s face is one of terror and all around her is death and despair. By her side, there is a hooded young man with a blurred face trying to rescue another crying child, holding him steadily in his arms. Next to him there is a masked nurse, whose face is unrecognizable, calling for reinforcements with her arm raised. They are all symbols of the kind of humanity that, in the midst of so much despair, rolled up its sleeves to help those in need, and represent the unity of purpose and aid proclaimed by the slogan in characters. The 3D style number 512 completes the work and stands for the date of the catastrophe, which occurred on the 12th of May. The fill-in colour is red, like the blood that was spilled, while the black depth represents the darkness of the catastrophe, and the yellow outline is a longed for glimmer of light highlighting the importance of the number. At the top of the work there are the artists’ signatures: from left to right we find the names BJPZ Crew in blue, followed by SOOS in black, 0528 in red, and MORE in yellow. On the left side, there is one last inscription on the protruding edge of the wall: Jinian Sichuan 纪念四川 (Commemorate Sichuan). The highly graphic cursive style with which Soos created this element, repeated in the penzi 喷子 (writer) characters situated vertically below it, recalls the zigzagging of the seismograph waves reproduced to the side, and stands as a reminder of the earthquake."@en ;

    ns3:description "This artwork was made in 2018 by the entire crew together with numerous Chinese and foreign writers at the Berlin Mural Fest, one of the world’s most important international festivals. In this huge graffiti, the lettering part, with the tags of some of the artists in yellow in the lower section, is counterbalanced by a gigantic and fierce red Chinese dragon, represented according to classical iconography (crocodile head, catfish-like whiskers, mane and deer horns, sinuous snake-like body swirling in the background, chicken legs with sharp claws, and a flaming tail). This is depicted in the act of spitting fire on sea waves, over which float inscriptions that seem to emerge from the flames. The piece is scattered with calligraphic inscriptions in characters, alongside reproductions of Chinese seals with the names of the various authors of the work in Latin letters or characters. From the inscription Pofanlong 破樊笼 (The birdcage has disintegrated) emerges a majestic dragon, “haunting” the walls with its writings. Next to it the English phrase “Joy in bottle” recalls the name of one of the writers of the piece (Joybo), while on the right a bottle spills water that floods the bottom of the piece. In this artwork, the crew widely refined their technique, although the mode of action remains unchanged, if more complex. In fact, in this graffito there are various juxtaposed wild style tags, distinct elements of Chineseness (dragon, calligraphy, seals), Chinese writing and/or inscriptions (from simple names of capital cities to actual inscriptions), and various puppets that animate the piece (dragon and a bottle full of other puppets). In addition, this piece is the result of international collaborations (the number of writers increased from three to about ten) and was created in Berlin."@en ;

    ns2:title "Red Bull Dragon (attributed name)" ;
    ns3:attributed-name "Red Bull Dragon"@en ;
    ns3:chinese-concept "Chinese red" ;
    ns3:chinese-visual-element "Dragon" ;
    ns3:description "The artwork commissioned by Red Bull in 2012 was made for celebrate the 10th anniversary of the “Red Bull Nanshan Open”, the most important international snowboarding competition held in Asia, which took place at the Nanshan Ski Village in Beijing. It is one of the countless works commissioned by famous brands, some are particularly successful because the goal of the crew to preserve their creative freedom and create something original and clearly recognizable was perfectly achieved. The piece consists of the yellow Red Bull inscription, created through elaborate wild style with 3D rendering. At the center stands the face of a red dragon, depicted according to the typical Chinese iconography, and two chicken legs harpooning the inscription and a shiny pearl. Traditionally, Chinese dragons breed by fertilizing a pearl that they usually hold in their jaws. In classical iconography, the pearl is sometimes flaming and is a symbol of wealth, prosperity and good fortune; the pearl here is not flaming but shiny, and contains the letter A, standing for ABS. We often find this kind of crew logo in their work. Although not flamboyant, the pearl is meaningful: two arrows on its sides respectively point at the official website of the crew and the names of the writers who created the piece: Seven, Noise, Andc, Smer. By portraying a dragon the crew wanted to celebrate the upcoming beginning of the Year of the Dragon. The competition was in fact held between 14 and 15 January and the Year of the Dragon, which was about to start on 23 January. According to the traditional Chinese calendar, consisting of twelve-year cycles, each year is associated with a different animal – mouse, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. The Chinese New Year does not coincide with the Gregorian calendar, but falls on the first new moon after the Sun enters the sign of Aquarius (between 21 January and 19 February). The famous slogan “Red Bull gives you wings” also certainly influenced the choice of the dragon as a puppet: the ABS crew decided to portray the creature that above all in their tradition flies with strength and vigor, with the intention of conveying the idea of power and robustness embodied by the dragon (and by the effects of Red Bull). In addition, the colors used in the graffiti – the yellow writing and the red dragon – are reminiscent of the colors of the Red Bull logo portrayed at the top left-hand corner of the work. The blue background evokes the idea of ice smashed by the might of the dragon, as well as the glacial and snowy landscape that frames the event; but is also a reference to the color of the Red bull can. The horizontal progression of the writing and its rounded edges recall the shape of the snowboard, which formed the basis of the sketch for the piece, as shown by one of the writers in the video on the making of the work. This is how Andc recounts this experience:“Red Bull has always supported our creative activity. The idea for the graffiti was ours, and Red Bull gave us a lot of creative freedom. […] In this case, Red Bull contacted us because they were looking for someone who had graffiti in their blood and would bring this out in their creative work. To us it sounded exciting to say the least, and therefore we accepted! […] The piece we made on that occasion was used as the backdrop of the stage at the awards ceremony.

    ns3:description "The artwork \"Tuo qi xiwang 托起希望 (Raising Hope)\" of 2009 was produced in memory of the Sichuan earthquake of 12 May 2008, which claimed approximately seventy thousand victims. The piece is a wild style renderings of the four characters of the title inspired by a chengyu, a common pattern with other crews (e.g. the Kwanyin Clan). The writing style is very edgy and basic, consisting of one or two fill-in colors spread evenly, a single outline, and only occasionally a hint of 3D. The result is somewhat “rigid” and reveals the embryonic state of his personal stylistic research, centered on the attempt to reshape Chinese writing by imitating American styles."@en ;

    ns2:title "Yuanyuan Armchair - Ease" ;
    ns3:description "This piece is part of a set of 5 armchairs by Minaxdo called \"Yuanyuan chairs\" (缘圆椅). This collection is inspired by the techniques of Chinese Calligraphy — the moves, turns, crochets, inclination and direction of the strokes of Chinese Characters are reflected in the modeling of every piece of furniture. Based on the essence of traditional calligraphy, these armchairs  features a smooth and elegant shape that resembles the flow of the running/cursive script.  'Yuanyuan’ (缘圆), which means 'round-perfect edge', indicates the fluency of calligraphy and it is reflected in the ergonomically designed armrests made from teak, rosewood. The handcrafted piece uses a mortise and tenon joint and each of the nodes represent the ‘pause’ of the calligraphy movements, giving a solid and dynamic appearance. Based on the Ming-style backed armchair, Yuanyuan Armchair – Ease features a dignified and fair form, as well as applying ergonomics to maximize the comfort level."@en,
        "中国古代文人尤重“风骨”，传统书法亦注重行云流水之中蕴涵铮铮笔意，外呈灵动，内收锋芒。“缘圆椅”取书法笔意之精髓，造型流畅典雅，宛若一挥而就的行草篇章，然设计制作严谨遵循受力原理，每一处节点都切合书法行笔中的“略停”而显得坚实有力。"@zh ;

    ns3:description "This work was exhibited for the firt time during the \"First Exhibition of Modern Calligraphy\" that was held in 1985 at the National Art Museum of China. It became the icon of this exhibition. It expresses the idea that the time had come for China to set aside old ideas and press ahead with reform. This approach marked a major break with tradition, representing a move towards the idea that the form of a calligraphic composition and the arrrangement of the characters within it should reinforce the meaning of the piece. The artist has used the form of the two characters of the title to reinforce the message of a verse by Li Bai that from a great upheaval new and good things would emerge. He achieves this through the strength and composition of the two main characters in the piece: in the upper left-hand corner a large character for 'mountain' (shan 山) looked as if being overturned by the force of the other main character, 'cui' 摧 ('destruction' or 'overturning')."@en ;

This stylized figure is the result of the transformation of the Chinese character “之” (\"go\") into a modern element. The character is written using Chinese calligraphic font. With the unity and the harmony of \"sky, earth and human beings,\" the logo incorporates Chinese characters, calligraphy and the Paralympic spirit. It embodies the Paralympic motto of \"Spirit in Motion\" and reflects the integration of heart, body and spirit in human beings -- the core of the philosophy of Chinese culture. The three colours in the logo represent the sun (red), the sky (blue) and the earth (green). The words “Beijing 2008” aro also written in calligraphic font. The designer enhances the aesthetic taste and gets a better visual effect through skillful combination and arrangement of dots and lines.  The shape of the athlete in motion accords with the seal of the Beijing Olympic Games."@en ;

The purpose of this exhibition is to promote Chinese culture in Taiwan through calligraphy art. Curator Tong Yang-Tze invites diverse and talented fashion designers of Chinese ethnicity to participate, create, and accumulate design context inspired by the calligraphy lines. Besides Tsai Yi-fen, other five desigers took part in the exhibition: two from Taiwan ( Chou Yu-Ying, Chen Shao-Yen), two from Beijing (Li Ying-Jun, Zhou You) and one from UK (Pan Bernice).The exhibition theme is “wú” 無 (emptiness). Tong Yang-tze wrote fourteen fonts of this character which are variations of the Cursive Script, Running Script, Regular Script, Clerical Script, and Seal Script. The forms of these characters are distinct, but designers must interpret them visually to form structures, materials, and prints from the fluidity of calligraphy lines and the spaces amongst them.
This collection by Tsai Yi-fen is composed of five dresses. It combines lacework and beaded embroideries to create unique textures and tailoring, displaying the space between the real and the void."""@en ;

Wearing a cloak of straw (suoyi 蓑衣) and a bamboo hat (douli 斗笠) and bringing with them paintings, calligraphies, and musical instruments, they wanted to look like people returning to their native village. Then, with the aid of a bamboo flute (xiao 箫), calligraphy and a silk scroll, they reproduced a banquet of literati: Zhang Weiliang played the flute, which does not sing melodies but reproduced the sound of water flowing and breaking on the boulders; in the meanwhile, Zhu Qingsheng wrote a calligraphy poem on the silk scroll suspended on the stream, that soaked it. Only the parts of the scroll that lay on the rock kept traces of ink; on those that instead sank in the stream, Zhu Qingsheng wrote directly in the water that washed away the ink. As a result, the “absorbed” characters had been taken away and only the soaked silk scroll remains." ;

Wu Wei deprives Chinese calligraphy of his traditional tools, methods and meanings: he doesn't uses paper and ink, the brush is no longer a calligraphic tool and the human body is only a deposit of the \"throwed brushes\". The artist makes a critique at the \"conforting pleasantness\" of the traditional Chinese art: the traditional culture is embodied by the brush, which produces a softing and conforting pleasantness on the skin. Through the ostentation of the body and the use of the brush as a \"tool of pleasure\", Wu Wei wants to provoke a state of shock in order to shake the viewer from the social and existential torpor in which he lives. According to Wu Wei, Chinese art is still strongly anchored to old styles and traditional tools and methods, so the artist is not free to express himself. The only way to break with the tradition is to overturn traditional tools and methods in a \"sensual/sexual\" provocative way."@en ;

In contrast to traditional calligraphy, he doesn't use ink and paper to write characters. The artist makes a critique at the \"conforting pleasantness\" of the traditional Chinese art: the traditional culture is embodied by the brush, which produces a softing and conforting pleasantness on the skin. Through the ostentation of the body and the use of  the brush as a \"tool of pleasure\", Wu Wei wants to provoke a state of shock in order to shake the viewer from the social and existential torpor in which he lives. According to Wu Wei,  Chinese art is still strongly anchored to old styles and traditional tools and methods, so the artist is not free to express himself.

    ns3:description """In this performance, Song Dong  writes characters on a flat stone. Instead of using ink, the artist uses the brush dipped in water to write a sort of invisible diary. Evaporating brushstrokes are methodically painted one on the top of the other, over and over again, on the same impassive surface. The text appears momentarily before vanishing and being replaced by the next fluid characters. Song Dong refers to this performance as an ongoing "private and personal event", a description that points to the essence of much of his practise. The artist sets aside time each day to think about life and living, and to let such thoughts dissolve through the water that flows from his brush. The contemplative nature of this process transforms it into an act of meditation. His intent as an artist is fundamentally iconoclastic: to disrupt categories, media hierarchies and bureaucratic as well as aesthetic expectations. And yet these "political" goals are achieved more often than not through works of art that are uncommonly intimate. Diaries serve a number of purposes, from keeping track of appointments to the documentation of events over time. They can be used to trigger memories or to reflect on ideas, emotions and reactions. The defining character of a diary, however, must surely be its self-confessional and innately private nature: diaries contain information relating to an individual, information that is written down rather than shared. Nevertheless with conventional diarising there is an inherent chance of disclosure; an awareness, on some level, that another person may at some time read what is initially written in secret. History is partly made of such discoveries. As Song Dong says: "You might not think about this generally but during the diary writing process consider that someone else might be reading this someday. Since considering this, I stopped writing a traditional diary". 
Song Dong is  not prepared to take the risk. Through his invisible journal, the artist continues to engage in the process of diary-keeping, comfortable in the knowledge that his thoughts will not be revealed. His diary can never be read. It can never offer up its contents, except to the writer, through the screen of his own memory. What is written cannot be retrieved. The words literally and metaphysically disappear. Song Dong confirms that he writes in the water diary everyday. If little has happened, he will record that there is nothing much to write. If he has been travelling, he will document the journey. Song Dong's description of the way the diary evolved indicates the central and deliberate role the work plays in his life: "After a while, this stone slowly became a part of me. That means I could say anything to it and be unscrupulous. This act became a part of life and it made me more relaxed". """@en ;

    ns3:description """In this hour-long performance, Song Dong is sitting cross-legged in a shallow portion of the Lhasa River in Tibet. He sistematically stamps the "sacred" river water with a large wood seal carved with the Chinese character for water (shui 水). Song Dong explores the impact of transcribed words that leave no semantic trace. According to the artist, the idea of this work came to him while attending an artists' symposium in Lhasa that examined the human impact on the natural world.  He learned from speaking with local residents of an annual ritual held on the fourth day of the fourth lunar month, when small statues of the Shakyamuni Buddha are immersed in the water. When the statue is in the water, the river bears the image of Buddha; when it is removed, the essence of Buddha remains. Song Dong adapted this idea by writing out a large regular-script version of the character shui 水 (water), and then having local craftsmen carve it into the wood. In his mind, stamping the river with this symbol, which was meant to represent the pure concept of water, became a way of ritually purifying it as it made its way from the Tibetan highlands to Beijing, where it arrives much polluted  owing to man's intrusions. In actuality the Lhasa River joins the Yarlung (or Brahmaputra) River, which flows into the Bay of Bengal, but in the artist's conception, it represented the head-waters of China's great rivers that, figurately at least, flowed to Beijing from whence political control flowed back to Tibet.
Song Dong carried out this performance twice: first, before a large audience; then, in front of a camera operated by his wife, the artist Yin Xiuzhen. To stage this second performance, Song and Yin rode bicycles to a spot about ten kilometers outside the center of Lhasa, where the camera would capture an image that included water, mountains and traces on man's presence. Song Dong stamped continuously for one hour, enough time to meditate on man's impact on the natural world, without knowing when Yin Xiuzhen would hold down the shutter release. Song Dong went on to explain that his posture, seated cross-legged in a shallow portion of the river, echoes that of the Buddha, while the replication of his image recalls the Thousand Buddhas motiv, a metaphor for the potential of all sentient beings to achieve Buddhahood. 
This performance invokes Buddhist and Daoist concepts, which advocate harmonizing the self with natural principles. Song's intention may have been to link traditional religious practise with a greater awareness of and reverence for the natural environment. Thus, the act of stamping the Chinese word for "water" onto a Tibetan river, may be read as a response to China's efforts to assert its cultural hegemony over Tibet."""@en ;

    ns3:description """The performance is composed of three different moments. In the first part of the performance ("1/2 Meat"), Zhang Huan is naked and he 'wears' a carcass of raw bovine meat, reminiscent of the armors of ancient Chinese warriors. In the second part of the performance ("1/2 Text"), Zhang Huan invites friends to write phrases or words on his face and body with black ink, so that Zhang Huan's ethnicity is literally inscribed on his body. In the last part of the performance ("1/2 Meat + Text"), Zhang Huan wears again the carcass of the raw bovine meat, but this time his  body is completely covered by written characters. 
The performance conveys different meanings and interpretations, based on three principal aspects of human life: individual, society and culture. 
Zhang Huan expresses the contradiction of human nature: on one hand the civil and rational side and on the other hand the primitive and animalistic side. Consequently, Zhang Huan's body becomes a medium that carries and expresses this dualistic concept. According to the Chinese philosophical tradition, body and mind are blended together and they represent a single vital unit. As Chinese characters are a product of the human mind, the artist's body serves as a support for the text. Writing is fused with the body so that mind and body are blended together. The bloody carcass of the animal represents the scarnification of the body, which is "overlapped" to the text. It is an element of division between the human body and the text, so it breaks the fusion between mind and body. The title "1/2" expresses that in contemporary times the traditional union/harmony between body and mind has been divided into two separate entities .
The carcass of the animal also represents the society, which is stripped from the "chaotic flesh and blood" of culture, customs and traditions. Society is deprived of its "vital pulp", that is culture, showing how the human mind is losing its value in contemporary society. 
Finally, this performance is a visual metaphor for the difficult transcultural experience upon which Zhang was about to embark. As an Asian body circulating within a Western culture, Zhang tries to make himself understood through his native language. He said: "The body is the only direct way through which I come to know society and society comes to know me. The body is the proof of identity. The body is language.\""""@en ;

    ns3:description """This public performance by Qiu Zhijie takes place in a museum of Oslo. The performer wears special shoes with the words "right" and "left" engraved to the sole both in Chinese characters and in latin letters. The performer is blindfolded and he tries to find the exit on the other side of a narrow hallway. On the floor, between the performance starting point and the exit, there is a line made of ink. If the performer walks straight, he reaches the exit without leaving any shoe prints behind. If he trails from the path, the words "left" and "right" will be imprinted to the surrounding floor, and he might run into the wall. The performance continues until the performer finally walks out of the exit.
Through this performance, Qiu Zhijie overturns the concept of "space", inverting its main terms (left/right). The space becomes a concealed place of dishorientation. The experience felt by the performer is emblematic of the condition of contemporary people, that have lost their certainties and their straight path. 

In 2002, Qiu Zhijie does a similar performance, entitled "The Long March: Left / Right"(长征 : 左右). In this performance, Qiu Zhijie becomes the performer. Qiu Zhijie wears a pair of special shoes during the road trip.  Beneath the left shoe there is a stamp depicting the character 右 (right) and the word "right", while beneath the right shoe there is the character 左 (left) and the word "left". In this manner, Qiu Zhijie leaves imprints of "left" and "right" during his journey. Most of the time the imprints remain invisible, and they exist unconsciously. These imprints are only visible when Qiu Zhijie walks across mud (on a soft soil) or when the shoe soils are wet after raining.  
This performance takes place in different locations, e.g. Lugu Lake in Yunnan , "Flying Tigers" airport in Lijiang, the site of Zunyi Meeting (in Guizhou), and the Luding Bridge in Sichuan.
These performances are part of the art project entitled "Long March - A Walking Visual Display". During this project, Qiu Zhijie and his partner Lu Jie, accompanied by over 250 people from China and abroad (artists, curators, writers, scholars), visited 12 of the 20 historical sites of China’s Long March. Working with local communities along the road in a renegotiation of the past and its multifaceted remembering, artworks were realised, performances enacted and affairs debated concerning a diverse array of issues, such as the question of authorship, place as a site of memory, and the meaning of social exchange through mobility.

    ns3:description "“Bright snow”, executed in 1985 by Shao Yan, is an artwork composed by two characters and a lower-left little inscription. The wo characters, qing  晴 (“bright”), whose edges look like carved wood signs, and xue 雪 (“snow”), fat and thick with a firm central part, represent a surprising contrast just like the sunlight that spreads with roar over the silent snow. For both characters, Shao Yan adopts the “flying white” (feibai飞白) technique, which means using the half-dry brush, in order to represent the wild landscape of Northern China struck by violent snowstorms. The little inscription is written with brushstrokes full of ink and it has an angular shape, balancing the entire calligraphy. This work is one of the first experimental works by Shao Yan: as the artist was influenced by the “few characters” Japanese calligraphic movement, the structure of each character embodies the meaning of the character itself."@en ;

    ns3:description """In this performance, Zhang Qiang collaborates with a woman named Zhang Kaini. The performance takes place in Zhang Qiang's studio of Huxi University Town (Shapingba District, Chongqing, called Chongqing University Huxi Campus).
The performance consists of eight different stages:
1. Free and in-frame interactive writing (Ziyou yu kuangjia nei hudong shuxie 自由与框架内互动书写) where the act of writing takes place "within a frame" as established by Zhang Kaini's will. This wooden object, which looks like a frame, is the wooden structure of Zhang Qiang's collaboration with the Belgian artist Lia Wei used during the "Biface Calligraphy" (shuangmian shufa 双面书法). When the 100-metre roll is hung overhead, the finished section flows out from underneath, like a "long stream". Zhang Kaini and Zhang Qiang are standing within this "abandoned frame" and the performative act takes place within a confined space.
2. The scenery on the drawing table (Hua an shang de fengguang 画案上的风光)
Zhang Qiang joined two boxes of equal height and similar width to make a large horizontal long drawing table, which he usually uses to practice traditional calligraphy and Chinese painting. On this table there are the basic furnishings of a traditional Chinese literary studio, with brass and wooden paperweights, crystal brush holders, ink beds, water pots, brush sinks, printing beds, seals, clay for printing, etc. There are also brushes of various types, and paper and silk of various colors.  The studio doors are higher than the roof, like the size of a church-like western door (which is rarely seen in Chinese home decoration). When the two tall heavy doors are closed, a sense of mystery is created and when the two meters thick doors are half open, a special scene is created. When Zhang Qiang lights the sandalwood incense, the fragrance begins to permeate the room like the "lines of a calligraphic cursive". Kaini lays back on the table and begins to shift her movements as the sandalwood incense dances around her. This time, in a psychedelic atmosphere, the body begins to express its own language. In this way, a traditional calligraphic and classical style of painting becomes a platform for body language performance and expression. Inside and outside the tall, heavy doors, the dreamlike expressions of Kaini's performance become a theatrical ritual: Kaini's body movement launches classical Chinese painting and calligraphy into a labyrinth of amusement.
3. The meaning released by the "Study of ancient inscriptions" ("Jinshi xue" de yiwei shifang “金石学”的意味释放)
Stone inscriptions were widely widespread in ancient China and were made on wood, metal, stone and bamboo. The content of these inscriptions  has generally a historical and artistic value. Therefore, the surface of the supports of these inscriptions are full of natural, temporal and man-made "wounds", revealing for example traces of natural erosion (such as on cliffs). Zhang Qiang calls this phenomenon the "aesthetic of wounds" (Shangkou meixue 伤口美学). What is important is the meaning behind the "wounds" and the role of their time dimension. Hence, rather than an "aesthetic of wounds", it could also be termed as an "aesthetic of the time dimension'' (Shijian weidu di meixue 时间维度的美学). This is because the "wounds" of these natural supports were formed in different time and specific spaces. 
In this phase of the performance, Zhang Kaini, originally from Shandong, interacts with three inscriptions of two of the most important calligraphers of Shandong: Zheng Daozhao 郑道昭 (? - 515)and the monk An Daoyi 安道壹 (?-580). In doing this, two different time dimensions come into contact: the past traces come back to life in a present performing action. The smiling silhouettes of Zhang Kaini, her ecstatic smiles, movements and facial expressions toward the inscriptions (the traces of the past) joined with the brushstrokes on her body and clothes (the traces of the present).
4. Framing body and strokes (Shenti kuangjia yu bifeng 身体框架与笔锋)
After the interactive writing in the wooden frame of the "Biface Calligraphy" (phase 1), in this phase of the performance Zhang Kaini began to conduct wanton action in this narrow space brandishing two huge brushes.
5. Performative writing, Traces of Desire and Body Vocabulary (Xingwei shuxie, yuwang zongji yu shenti cishu 行为书写、欲望踪迹与身体辞书)
At this fase, Zhang Kaini draws on a sheet of paper placed on the floor with two huge brushes and her body. While she writes consciously with her body on one side of the sheet, her hands unconsciously write on the other side of the sheet with the brushes. The sultry red high heels that Zhang Kaini is wearing have the same effect as seals in calligraphy, insinuating themselves firmly into various places. 
In Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report, and also in this performance, the first thing that is subverted is the basic relationship between the subject and the object of representation (writing), where the subject writes and the paper anxiously awaits the writing. The writer who is also the performer, with her back to the object, abandons the expression of her will to write, while her body freely moves during the writing process, breaking the traditional writing relationship.
6.  Traces on face (Wenyang 纹样 )
In Chinese, the wen character "文" (wen) is interchangeable with "纹" (wen) and it indicates the action of "leaving a trace" by humans. Similarly, the word "样" not only has the meaning of "style/model/shape", but also indicates the aspect of a person's face. Zhang Qiang therefore uses the expression "纹样" for this part of the performance, because he leaves traces (wen 纹) on the face of a person (yang 样) who is Zhang Kaini. The ink, scattered on the face in a chaotic manner, interferes with the facial features, giving new expression to the subject through the performance action. 
7. Paper shifts writing (Zhi mian nuoyi shuxie 纸面挪移书写)
In this phase, Zhang Qiang interacts with Zhang Kaini in the same way of the "Zhang Qiang Trace Report A/B Model" (1990 - 2000, see the "Series of Creative Works" in the archive). 
8. Free styling/free form (Ziyou zaoxing 自由造型)
The so-called "free form" consists of arbitrary and random movements. This phase is based on accidental stimulations of a non-specific situation. The surprise of movement therefore depends entirely on inner strength, as well as on the coordination of imagination and movement. The selected backgrounds (e.g. a Persian carpet, a vase of Aloe plant, a black cloth, etc.)  reveal an unconscious choice between the "performing action" (xingwei dongzuo 行为动作) and the "selected shooting" (xuanze paishe 选择拍摄). For example, the movement of the Persian carpet motif in the background of some photographs of the performance easily recalls the notion of "free will" (ziyou yizhi 自由意志) and suggests that between the cultural psychological structure of the background motifs and the "individual freedom" (geti ziyou 个体自由) of the brush and ink, there is also the body of the performer as a mediating expression of the connection between the two. 

This performance is part of the "A/X series". (cinese) This series consists of about thirteen "free performances" (ziyou xingwei “自由行为”) from 2015 to 2017. These performances place greater emphasis on the concepts and initiatives of the counterpart (Zhang Kaini, for example, pays close attention to express her thoughts during the performance). The A/X series is part of the A/C series but it is more experimental and "free", because puts more emphasis on the initiative of female collaborators.
A similar performance entitled: "Zhang Qiang Traceology Report A/X8 (South America) [张强踪迹学报告A/X8（南美)] took place at Sanya Bay Beach (in the south end of Hainan) on January 10, 2017. Photographs of the scene taken by professional photographers named Yan Lu and Zheng Jian clearly show how these South American dancers, under Chinese ink and brushstrokes, are able to reveal their sublime body language.

    ns3:description "“Surrounding” (Wei 圍 / 围) executed in 1991 by Shao Yan, is composed by two opposing heavy vertical lines that incline from upper left to lower right and frame the artwork, and two horizontal lines that continue beyond the edge of the paper and appear cropped or abbreviated. Inside the frame, the first two horizontal lines are executed in centered-tip brushwork with “flying white” technique while the two horizontal lines in the lower part of the work are drown with moist ink, spread toward the right and merge in a heavier stroke. In the upper part of the work Shao Yan executes a vertical line that parallels the two lines framing the work and another one to the right side that inclines from left to right. In the lower part he brushes a short and thick vertical line placed off-centerd (compared with the central position it takes in the character “wei”). In the middle part Shao Yan executes the element “口”, in a trapezoidal shape rather than in the original square shape. This element works with the four lines of the frame to balance the entire work. Although the outlines of this work seem to represent an ancient city wall where people are forced to live, the reference to reality is minimal and the work tends towards abstraction. In this work Shao Yan was influenced by “few characters” Japanese calligraphic movement and Western abstract expressionism, in particular by Franz Kline."@en ;

Influenced by the painters Liu Guosong  刘国松 (1932 -) and Zhou Shaohua 周韶华 (1929 -), in 2001 the artist introduces a new technique consisting of the repeated execution of strokes on the paper which will later be washed in water. After the washing process, the path taken by the tip of the brush shines clearly on the paper, there is a large amount of ink and various intense gradiations. Shao Yan pays particular attention to the spacial order and the composition of the artwork but, introducing the element of water, he adds the concept of time to the construction of calligraphic space. He thus emphasises the instantaneous and unrepeatable nature of artistic creation.
Compared to “Sea” executed in 1995, this artwork is characterised by three-dimensional lines and better reproduces the blue-green color of the sea, its illusory and calm appearance and the abstract aesthetic beauty of form until the work reaches the perfect union of form and content."""@en ;

    ns3:description """"Army" (Jun 军) is an artwork executed in 2003 by Shao Yan. Influenced by Western analythical cubism, the artist modifies the original structure of the characters preventing their identification, denies the concept of classical perspective and destroys the calligraphic space, breaking it up and reorganising it into simple geometric shapes such as triangles and polygons.
In “Jun” the geometric structure is concentrated on the central line while the outermost part, towards the edge, is airier and more open. Shao Yan thus wants to emphasise the layering and light effect produced by the geometric cut. The material structure is dominated by the geometric appearance of the lines that gather into inclined angular planes, and the straight lines and oblique planes suggest the changing position of the Chinese character structure. Shao Yan executed the work using ink 'washed' with water, which, unlike Western oil painting, softens the geometric deconstruction of the characters structure."""@en ;

    ns3:description """“Peach blossoms fall in a chaotic rain of red dust” is an “artwork with more characters” (duozishu chuangzuo多字数创作) executed by Shao Yan in 1995 which earned him the first prize at the Sixth National Exhibition of Young Calligraphers and Seal Engravers. The work, considered by the author himself the most representative work of modern calligraphy he had ever created until 2011, when he brushed out “Flying Good Luck” (see the artwork in the archive), is characterised by a huge variation in the thickness of the lines and by words that seem to radiate from the centre of the work and to continue beyond the paper’s edge. The words are executed in an original cursive form,
 achieved by frequently changing the speed and direction of the brush until the characters become almost unreadable, in order to emphasise the harmony and movement of the lines.Shao Yan drew inspiration from the poem “Invitation to Wine” (Jiangjinjiu 将进酒), written by the poet Li He 李贺 (790-816) in which the author describes the day of youth about to twilight through the image of peach blossoms falling like red rain and invites people to spend their last happy years of youth in the company of wine and entertainment.The artwork is executed not only with a usual brush but also with doubi 斗笔, a large brush with the tip mounted on the final part of the bucket-shaped handle. The artwork is executed in a vertical format to call to the viewer's mind the poetic image of the falling peach blossoms and it is composed by horizontal lines and dots that cover the work and recall the lines of a score embellished with musical notes. This creates a perfect union between the spatial structure of Chinese characters and the temporal rhythm, which reminds of the crackling red rain. With this artwork, Shao Yan does not want to reproduce the meaningful forms of the characters but wants to convey to the observer the feeling evoked by the poetic verses."""@en ;

    ns3:artwork-type <https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22669850> ;
    ns3:description "“The Thirty-Six Stratagems of using ink” is an artwork composed of 36 squares executed in 2008 by Shao Yan using a new tool: a syringe with a small ink reservoir. The title of this work is inspired by the literary work called “The Thirty-Six Stratagems” (Sanshiliuji 三十六计), an essay used to illustrate series of stratagems, used in politics, war and civil interaction. Using this reference, Shao Yan wants to \"fight death\" through the artistic action. When in 2007 the artist was hospitalized to undergo several heart surgeries, he realized that the brush was a tool too far from his heart, so he thought that the syringe could link him better with the experience of life and death he had lived, and began experimenting with it. This artwork is, in fact, Shao Yan's first experiment using a syringe of ink instead of a brush, the so called “ink shooting” (shemo 射墨) to write lines without meaning. The thick ink, squirting out of the syringe toward the paper, reminds of blood and the artist's life is the force that drives the tool. The entire artistic process is characterized by the force of the syringe, the force of gravity, the speed of the jet and the direction that create numerous ink marks of multiple shapes. Through this early experiment with the syringe, Shao Yan was amazed by the fan-like shapes that the ink, hurled at high speed like a projectile, formed on the paper, and this expedient enabled him to produce different shapes of lines and marks."@en ;

    ns3:description "“Flying Good Luck” is a huge artwork executed in 2011 by Shao Yan that represents his greatest masterpiece. For this work, he used a long and sharp brush, which he dipped in thick ink to execute the characters in cursive script. With a series of sharp strokes on the paper, changes of direction, arching and lifting the brush, Shao Yan brushed the first two characters, fei 飞 (“to fly”) and lai 来 (“to come”), from the upper part toward the lower part of the work. At this point, he dipped the brush in a small amount of ink, lifted it up, quickly drawing in the air a semi-circular arc and scattering dots of ink in order to give life to the character hao 好 (“Good”). To execute the character yun 运 (“Luck”) he used the paibi 排笔 (a brush composed of small brushes joined together) tilted at a 45-degree angle and loaded with ink. In the bottom right-hand corner Shao Yan placed two seals in vermilion red that balance the work. The artwork evokes the image of a boat carried by the wind: the oblique part of the character \"yun\" recalls the prow of the boat hit by the splashing waves, the vertical strokes of \"yun\" 云 \"lai\" 来 and \"hao\" 好 symbolize the mast of the boat and the ink splashes represent the sails rolled up by the wind."@en ;

The character xi 西 (West, Western) in the center of the piece is shaped like a yellow sullen face. It is interesting to note how the puppet xi 西 meaning "West, Western" is interlocked between two red colored Chinese characters that are not puppets. 
The yellow figurative element with a sullen face recalls an apple, that probably could stand for "the big apple" in memory of New York city. 
On the right side of the piece, there is the writing "Contact @dezio.fr"."""@en ;

    ns3:description """The artwork "Chai 拆" (To Demolish) was painted in 2008 as a reaction to the city’s rapid dismantling and a protest against the demolition of historic, old buildings. De facto, the character "chai 拆" means "to demolish a building and relocate the inhabitants" and is basically used to mark an old building that had been scheduled for demolition. It is usually painted in red on house walls. In the "chai 拆" piece, Dezio portrays his protest against the demolition of old buildings by personifying the "chai 拆" character: on the left, the radical "hand 扌" becomes a hand holding a hammer and "hitting" the radical "jin 斤" (on the right side), depicted as an old Chinese house in the process of demolition. The personified "chai 拆" is painted with a white fill-in and a black outline and is bombed with lots of original Chinese "chai 拆" characters, marked in red and circled. 
On the left side, there is the tag "dezione", on the right side there is the year of the creation "2008".
The  "Chai 拆”" character has two different backgrounds: the first is a yellow burning star with a red outline, the second is the black wall.

Her creations are put on by the professional model Cao Rui 曹蕊, who assists Zhang Qiang in his art by allowing him to paint on the paper dresses she is wearing. 
A fundamental condition that emerges here is the "dressing up women's self" (nuxing ziwo de zhuang ban 女性自我的妆扮). Cao Rui is no longer a passive model and the collaboration is natural, based on the idea of parallelism. Cao Rui, the female performer, is wearing dresses created by the female fashion designer Zhao Jingyu. The female counterpart (Cao Rui + Zhao Jingyu) both creates and acts. Zhang Qiang, the male counterpart, with this performative writing, also does both simultaneously. So, the entire performance naturally evolves into an interesting practice of "gender difference" (xingbie chayi 性别差异)."""@en ;

The artist added water to the ink in the syringe and then injected it on the paper allowing it to flow strong and free. The syringe emits a rustling sound that remembers the heart's pained cry when blood is sucked through the aorta artery.The work has a bitter taste because it is a reminder of the experience between life and death lived by the artist during various heart surgeries. Shao Yan decided to limit the work beauty by only executing solid lines. The initial buzzing sound emitted by the ink escaping from the syringe, gradually fades into silence. The sound could represent the flowing blood that, when stopping, puts an end to life."@en ;

    ns3:description """“Desolation” is an enormous artwork executed in 2008 by Shao Yan who was now increasingly interested in social topics and involved in deep thoughts about the meaning of life. On 12 May 2008, Sichuan Province in southwestern China was devastated by a magnitude-7.9 earthquake which caused the collapse of buildings, schools and roads and the death of at least 70,000 people. Shocked by the news, Shao Yan decided to carry out “Desolation” (You 幽), to express, through the deconstruction of "you", the reflection and fear provocked by the tragic event occured. Speaking of this work, he said that the paper reminded him of the earthquake-stricken land of southern China and that he was given the mission to save the world, grab the devil by the throat, save the Earth, even secure human beings, make the mountains and rivers peaceful and enchanting places. 
Shao Yan uses a paibi 排笔 brush (composed of small brushes joined together) and a long-tipped brush. The concave bottom of the character "you", that should be intact and smooth, appears instead as a shaking groove. The bottom left corner tilts out of the work while the top right corner leaps in mid-air, filling the work with an enormous sense of instability like mountains collapsing as the earth quakes. The central part of the work is executed with a dry brush that creates the shapes of the cracks. Both '幺' elements of the character tilt and succumb together with the entire structure. The work is criss-crossed by dots and ink splashes that look like a crowd scattering in different directions but, there is no possibility to escape because it is impossible to elude natural disasters."""@en ;

    ns3:description """This performance is held by Shao Yan in 2017  at the "Taishan Large-Scale Painting and Calligraphy Art Expo" - Shangdong province (泰山大型书画艺术品博览会). The artist uses several syringes full of ink injecting it to a long sheet of paper. This new technique is called shemo 射墨 (Ink Shooting).
The video of this performance begins circulating on internet in 2018, filming Shao Yan during his calligraphic performance.  Helped by several assistants who held a long sheet of paper, the artist squirts streams of ink with four syringes by means of sudden movements, being acclamed by the astonished spectators. In a short time, the video becomes widely known and triggers different reactions: there are those who appreciate this innovative technique and those who do not like the novelty, wondering if it is still calligraphy or not. Shortly afterwards, the artist has been interviewed in his studio in Songzhuang, a district of Beijing, by Song Yusheng 宋宇晟, a correspondent of the "China News", who wanted to know more about his art and about his opinion on the criticism he had received since the video was released. Shao Yan answered by saying: “People have always some argument when talking about pioneering works and I can understand that. They are ordinary people who don’t know what art is, even some calligraphers don’t understand either. However, the artist has a mission in this sense, which is to visually guide the viewer." In addition, to those who argued that his ‘Ink shooting’ could not be called calligraphy because characters were absent, he retorted by saying: "Do you recognise the cursive script when it is written? Why do you call it calligraphy if you don't recognise it? If you don't write Chinese characters, you have to go beyond writing Chinese characters. That's what I've done. I've been thinking about this for years. Yesterday, it occurred to me that it could be called ‘Shao Yan's calligraphy’ (Shao Yan de shufa 邵岩的书法) or ‘Shao Yan's ink shooting’ (Shao Yan de shemo 邵岩的射墨) both are fine. If you say it's not, then it's not." [...] "I have my theory, and it's quite valid. Right?"
Since 2017, Shao Yan continues executing these performances in several  Chinese cities, animating the debate about the real nature of calligraphy. """@en ;

    ns3:description """Shanshui PIC 山水 PIC (Landscape painting PIC) was the first Kwanyin Clan masterpiece where the “Chineseness” was so evident because it deeply linked to Chinese traditional art and culture. Thus, by mixing traditional and modern elements, in Shanshui PIC the Kwanyin Clan has successfully created what can be described as a Chinese landscape painting in the form of contemporary graffiti.
This enormous graffiti artwork measuring 42 m in length and about 2 m in height and it was created during the “China’s First Graffiti Exhibition” (Zhongguo shoujie tuya meili yishuzhan 中国首届涂鸦魅力艺术展) held at the Beijing International Exhibition Hall Square from 8th to 11th November 2007. Shanshui PIC was a collective work: all members of the crew were involved in this work, and it took five days to finish it. The landscape scenery in the background was painted by VIGA, NATO, YUMI, JOEY, and CTN; the long calligraphy on the upper left by EricTin; and the lettering pieces nested in the mountains (from left to right) by YUMI, EricTin, APART (a.k.a. ZXZ), QUAN, SCAR, JER, and VIGA. Regarding the title of the work, it is worth noting that the expression “shanshui 山水”, which translates as “landscape painting”, consists of two distinct characters: shan 山, meaning “mountain”, and shui 水, meaning “water”. In Chinese landscape paintings, mountains and rivers are essential elements as they represent the backbone of the entire composition. PIC is an abbreviation for piece, but is also easily confused with “picture” (image, drawing) (Valijakka 2015, p. 263). As the title suggests, in this work, the crew took inspiration from the Chinese traditional landscape painting. They wanted to reproduce the arrangement of Song Dynasty (960-1279) landscape paintings, like for example “Travelers Among Mountains and Streams” (Xi shan xing lü tu 溪山行旅图), “A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains” (Qianli Jiangshan tu 千里江山图), and “Dwelling in the Mountains” (Shanju tu 山居图). The whole composition, in fact, is characterized by typical elements and arrangement of landscape painting: mountains in the background and a long river in the foreground (you shan you shui 有山有水), a thick mist surrounding the mountains, a lush vegetation (trees and bushes) on its banks, clusters of huts in the valleys, and fishing boats on the river waves. The layout of the piece is also reminiscent of the handscroll, and the colors recall those of monochrome ink painting, the highest form of Chinese painting, which only involves the use of black ink in all its nuances, and the natural color of the paper roll to create works with a strong expressive power. The whiteness of the paper is used to render the water of streams, mist and clouds. This is one of the peculiar characteristics of this type of painting, which we find perfectly reproduced in this graffito: the black of the ink in various gradations (up to grey) and the whiteness of the paper in various shades (up to ochre). The colors (black, white and grey) are typical of Chinese “ink wash painting” (shuimo hua 水墨画): the black of the ink in various concentrations (up to grey) and the white of the paper (up to light ocher as age-yellowed paper). The format of the composition is similar to a “horizontal scroll” (hengfu 横幅), the typical format of this type of painting. The “spray-painting” technique used here by the Kwanyin Clan indeed mirrors the “cunfa” 皴法 (wrinkle method), a Chinese ink painting technique normally used for the surface of rocks and mountain reliefs. The five steps that characterize “cunfa” technique are based on particular brush strokes: 1) “outline” (gou 勾); 2) “texture” (cun 皴), e.g., the veins created by the brush within the outline to “wrinkle” the stones; 3) “rub” (ca 擦), which consist of spreading ink with a dry brush to accen tuate the rough texture of rock surfaces, logs and mountain slopes; 4) “render” (ran 染), e.g., applying colour to the landscape with light ink; 5) “dot” (dian 点), e.g., the tracing of dots to represent the vegetation in the background and the musk on the trees (Illouz 1989, pp. 104-113). While using spray cans instead of brushes, the Kwanyin Clan adopts a similar methodology in this work, where it: 1) transfers the sketch outlines to the panel (gou); 2) fills in the outlines with different colours (cun); 3) uses different caps to vary thicknesses and effects (ca); 4) draws final outlines (after filling in, to further define the lettering) (ran); 5) adds dripping and “dotting” effects to the piece (dian). The method used to give depth to the piece is also taken from the classical tradition: this is the “three distances” (sanyuan 三元) methodology, devised by the famous Song dynasty painter Guo Xi (1020-1090) to create the illusion of depth in Chinese landscape painting. This illusionary effect (of space and distance) has been recreated through the skillful use of spray cans and caps and by particular painting techniques, like for example cutting lines and “fade” (blended) colors. The presence of two calligraphies (one in the middle and one on the upper left) is also another reference to traditional landscape painting that is always embellished by calligraphic inscriptions. The first inscription in the center of the scroll is written in “big characters” (dazi 大字) and in “regular script” (kaishu 楷书), while the second one is composed of 45 columns of Chinese characters written in “cursive script” (caoshu 草书). The first calligraphy is placed at the center of the work and consists of two macro-characters Guan Yin 觀音, the name of the crew, which is the most intelligible of the five fundamental styles of Chinese calligraphic art. As per traditional calligraphy, the characters are written vertically and the variation in the thickness of the strokes determined by the different brush pressure applied on the paper is here achieved through the skillful use of spray paint and is a contemporary expedient to create the illusion of being in front of a classical calligraphy written with the ink brush. What is not traditional is the presence of the names of the crew members, written horizontally and in Latin letters at the bottom: on the left, Quan, EricTin, Yumi, Apart, Jer, Nato, Scar and, on the right, Joey, Keno, Pluto, Viga, Ctn, Kwanyin. The simultaneous use of Latin letters and Chinese characters is a recurring motif in the Kwanyin Clan works and embodies the blend of elements from China (vertically written characters) and the West (horizontally written Latin letters), both traditional (use of calligraphy) and modern (tags of the crew members). In the second calligraphy, the variation of the width of the strokes, the illegibility of the characters (that is typical of cursive script), and the reading direction (from right to left) follow the traditional calligraphic manner, while the widespread “dripping” effect underlines the graffiti taste. The second inscription, on the upper left-hand corner, is a long calligraphy written in a highly stenographic cursive style (caoshu 草书), in which the strokes of the characters are merged sometimes, impairing their recognizability. It is written in vertical columns to be read from right to left and from top to bottom, as is customary in classical Chinese, and is embellished by a pronounced dripping effect, which seems to simulate ink drippings on paper. According to EricTin’s statement (interview, 2016), the content of the calligraphy was inspired by a poem by Teng Zijing (990-1047), a famous Song dynasty poet, entitled “Immortal at the River” (Lin jiang xian 临 江仙). In the poem, Teng Zijing describes the enchanting landscape surrounding Dongting Lake (Hunan Province) on a foggy autumn morning and evokes a deep melancholy atmosphere, recalling the ancient legend of the gods of the Xiang River (E Huang and Nü Ying, the two wives of the mythical emperor Shun, died of grief at the death of their husband). Legend has it that the emperor Shun (2294-2194 BC) travelled to a village near Shunyuan Peak (in the Jiuling mountains in Hunan) to fight a dangerous snake and set the village free. Unfortunately, the snake bit him to death near the Xiang River. His two wives, E Huang and Nü Ying, daughters of the first emperor Yao, set out to find their husband. When they arrived where he had been killed, being unable to find his body, they were consumed by grief: dying, they turned into two mountain peaks (Ehuang Peak and Nüying Peak). For this reason, the two women have been remembered ever since as “The Ladies of the Xiang” or “The Gods of the Xiang River”. Teng Zijing’s poem referring to this episode reads as follows: Lake water embraces the sky, Glows brightly in crystal autumn. Jun mount is a piece of paradise And a mist from the Yun and Meng Marshes Has beleaguered the city of Yueyang. Xiang River Goddesses play the lute Ancient memories sad hearts lacerate Orchid’s whispering delicately scented No one can be found whence the melodies ended On upper river verdant peaks silently stand. The choice of Teng Zijing’s poem was determined by a specific purpose. The Kwanyin Clan want to write a poem able to communicate the feelings of loneliness and sadness following a joyful reunion and at the same time able to evoke the landscape scenery painted in the background of their artwork. Teng Zijing’s poem best achieves both these goals, even if the themes of loneliness, melancholy, and nature description are in common with all the listed poems. Because of this similarity, here the quotations’ mechanism is particularly suitable for the crew’s intentions because it refers to hypertexts that share the basic themes of the source text, but amplifying their possible meanings. According to EricTin, in fact, the main function of Teng Zijing’s poem is to describe the content of their artwork and at the same time to express not only the sense of happiness experienced in the encounter with a graffiti work, but also the feelings of loneliness and sadness following this encounter. EricTin explains that this encounter usually ‘lasts very briefly’ (tan hua yi xian 昙花一现) because of the ephemeral and localized status of any graffiti piece. Very few people can see their originals and, at the end, only some photos stored in a computer remain as their records. So the joy of the meeting is replaced with the pain of the parting and the melancholy of the oblivion, as all the ‘quoted’ poems have already testified. The use of a “poem” (shi 诗) as the content of a “calligraphy” (shu 书) to enhance the depiction of a “painting” (hua 画) suggests the so-called “three perfections” (san jue 三绝): the indissoluble artistic trinity of poetry, calligraphy and painting (shi shu hua 诗书画) that every literate and erudite person had to be able to practice and master in imperial China and that was often employed within the same artwork, making it a true masterpiece (Sullivan 1980). In this work, in fact, the binomial between poetry and painting was realized by Teng Zijing’s verses that are a vivid representation of the scenery and by the landscape painting that can be described as being “poem-like” (shi yi ban de 诗一般的); the binomial between calligraphic technique and literally content has been restated by the use of “cursive script”: its fastness embodies the fleeting nature of the joy of the encounter described in Teng Zijing’s poem. The binomial between calligraphy and painting is realized by the use of the same artistic instrument: traditionally it was the brush, here is the spray can that is employed to shape both calligraphy and painting producing similar effects. Crossing these three binomials, Shanshui PIC is a worthy example of the perfect triangulation of the “three perfections” in a contemporary graffiti artwork. However, in addition to all these Chinese traditional references, there are also two important and innovative elements that conform to graffiti conventions and transform this work into a beautiful ‘street scenery’ of contemporary times. These elements are: i) the enormous live motion figure of a graffiti writer portrayed in three different poses between the two calligraphies, and ii) the large tags of the six members of the crew (Yumi, EricTin, Quan, Scar, Jer, Viga), which stand out among the mountains and have been transcribed through an accentuated use of 3D style and wildstyle. The first element (the graffiti writer in the left section) is the most important figurative element of this graffiti work. This figure represents an alter ego of all the members of the crew. In fact: he is wearing hip-hop urban clothing (a pair of large pants, big hoodie, cap, and sneakers); he holds a spray can in his right hand, which represents his “artistic weapon”; and his movements resemble those of a b-boy (break-dancer). He is the connection between the entire piece and American hip-hop culture, of which graffiti is an important part. At the same time, he can be compared to a modern-day calligrapher, who, instead of “dancing with the brush while the traces of ink record his movement”, dances with his spray can, while the paint records his action on a hall of fame. The depiction of this character has a multiple function: i) it underlines the strict relationship between graffiti and hip-hop culture in China, and consequently interconnects the Chinese graffiti movement with all the other graffiti movements that are characterized by the same strict relationship (first of all the American one) all over the world. ii) Thanks to the live motion and the b-boy features, the figure of the graffiti writer can be compared to a ‘calligrapher’ of contemporary times. The b-boy painted in this work is ‘dancing’ with a spray can while the traces of its spray painting record his movements on a graffiti wall. iii) Opposite to traditional canons, however, the dynamics of his movements is also used to contrast the static nature of the classical landscape painting in the background in order to capture (and reproduce) the contrastive speed of life in modern times. iv) The size of the character, extremely big if compared to the rest of the work, is also an expedient to mark the difference between graffiti and classical landscape paintings. According to Chinese classical standards, and in particular to Northern Song style, in fact, the presence of human actors (such as scholars admiring the beauty of nature, travelers in the middle of a journey, and farmers and fishermen engaging in everyday labor), even if is an integral component of the whole composition (because nature was conceived to be a place of wonder in its own right and a space where human beings live, work, and seek spiritual learning and regeneration), it is diminutive in its scale, because Chinese philosophy stresses how the human presence is minor in the vastness of the cosmos. v) The big size of the human actor contrasts not only with the classical standards but also with the canons of contemporary Chinese landscape paintings. In contemporary Chinese landscape paintings, in fact, there is usually no place of human presence because of the anti-humanistic nature of Chinese recent urban development. In this graffiti work, the choice of depicting an overstated human figure dressed as a graffiti writer is a way to highlight the main aim of the crew (and of graffiti culture in general), that is a re-appropriation of the urban spaces by the writers themselves, presenting themselves as ‘modern graffiti painters’. In Shanshui PIC, the Kwanyin Clan demonstrates the ability to use Euro-American graffiti styles and techniques as well as the unprecedented capability to adapt Chinese traditional forms and classical aesthetics to contemporary graffiti, combining the aesthetics of traditional landscape painting and the artistic taste of contemporary graffiti in a perfect fusion of literati tradition and modern graffiti mood.

    ns3:description "Best wishes (Ruyi 如意) is an artwork executed in September 2022 by Shao Yan. This artwork belongs to a series of works executed by the artist during September 2022. Inspired by Ming “blue and white porcelain” (Qinghuaci青花瓷), the artist writes the two characters ruyi 如意 on a Chinese porcelain bottle vase (composed of a globular body and a long thin neck), employing a brush and blue ink. The character \"ru\" 如 is written in running script (行书) and also the character \"yi\" 意 is written in running script, but its component parts \"li\" 立 and \"ri\" 日 are written using the seal script forms (zhuanshu zixing 篆书字形). Shao Yan combines the structure of the characters and the shape of the bottle mouth vessel creating a work of unique elegance and beauty. The series is composed of several white vases of different shapes and types (“bottle” vase, “plum” vase, “gourd” vase, “pear shaped” vase, “cylinder” vase etc.) , which are carried out using two distinct tools and techniques: for some of them, Shao Yan writes the characters with a brush while he holds the vase steady with his free hand or he gets help from his assistants. For other works, he uses a syringe to inject the blue ink on the vessels that are located on a rotating base. For the entire collection, Shao Yan writes auspicious words carrying a good-luck meaning and he aims to combine the structure of Chinese characters or the lines and marks formed by the ink jet with the shapes of porcelain vases."@en ;

Zhang Qiang used a roll of silk (a type of silk called juan "绢") then folded it in half and created a slit in the middle, asking the models (Rachel and Claire Portal) to wear it. Zhang Qiang, looking away from the female counterparts  realizes calligraphic traces on the models' bodies and clothes.

        "Sanjue" ;
    ns3:chinese-visual-element "Seal" ;
    ns3:description """This artwork is a perfect example of the use of calligraphy and Chinese writing in a Kwanyin Clan’s work: the crew shaped a graffiti piece in Chinese characters embellished with calligraphic inscriptions and painted with the typical colours of traditional calligraphy (white, grey, black, and red – the colour of seal/s). 
The central part of the work is composed of the four characters of the title (shi ru po zhu 势如破竹) written in a very hard wildstyle. They form a Chinese "four-character idiom" (chengyu 成语) and are surrounded by other two wildstyle pieces: the first one, on the upper left, is probably by EricTin, because of the leitmotiv of the sphere with the traditional character "Guan 觀" in the centre, and of the thin pinnacles sprouting from the intricate characters; the second one, on the lower right, is by Yumi (the small tag written in red confirms his authorship) and its undecipherable forms suggest a big fire whose flames burn and generate the whole artwork. The central piece is by Nat, because the letters of his name (NaTuo) are intermingled and blended into the strokes of the Chinese characters. In addition to the diagonal stripe composed of these three pieces, there are two other important elements in this work: the long black calligraphy in the top right corner, and the red colophon in the bottom left corner.
The insertion of the chengyu "shi ru po zhu 势如破竹" in the central piece of the work has a specific purpose. As EricTin explains: "I like using four-characters chengyu as the basis of my works, because there is always a story behind them that exceeds the literal meaning of the four characters". The literal meaning of shirupozhu is "having a power (shi) to (ru) cut down (po) a bamboo (zhu)". It originally refers to the act of smashing into enemy territory "like splitting a bamboo". This idiom refers to the traditional way of splitting bamboo by cutting a slit on the top of it in such a way that it splits in two halves. The idiom describes incisive and "overwhelming power”. 
This reference to an "overwhelming power" is probably an indirect quote of the motto of the crew "push forward with an overwhelming momentum" recorded in their logo. This expression comes from the Book of Jin (Jinshu 晋书): it is quoted in the fourth chapter of the third section about Biographies (lie zhuan 列传) of the Book, that is the 34th volume (juan 卷) of the whole text. The second half of this chapter focuses on Du Yu 杜预 (222-285), a military general of the Wei state (220-265) in the late Three Kingdoms period (220-280) and early Jin Dynasty (265-420). In 265, the ruler of the Wei state abdicated in favour of the Prince Sima Yan 司马炎 (236-290), who ended the Wei state and became the first emperor of the Jin Dynasty. Du Yu became one of his most powerful general and he led an army in the conquest of the Wu state (222-280), their bitter rival. In 280, before the last and crucial attack against the Wu army, Du Yu pronounced the four characters of the chengyu (shi ru po zhu) to incite the troops, reminding them that until that moment they had smashed into enemy territory without difficulty "like splitting bamboo", so they must not be afraid to join the battle. His speech produced the desired effect: his army won the battle, the Wu state was conquered and the Chinese territory was reunified. Using this chengyu, the Kwanyin Clan wants to connect Du Yu’s story with the main theme of the artistic project that inspired its graffiti work. 
According to EricTin, in fact, Shirupozhu was shaped from 4th to 6th February 2008 at the Nike 706 Art Space in the 798 Art District. This art space was established in January 2007 in the subfactory 706 by Nike China, so it was called "Nike 706". The main aim of this cultural experience centre is to promote Nike brand and to ignite Chinese athletes, leveraging the power of creativity, sport, and self-expression. In 2008, the Kwanyin Clan joined a project entitled Lebron Experience Center, one of the two projects sponsored by Nike China to explain and promote the game of basketball to the Chinese public through a series of pieces showing the history and the future of the game, which is personified by Michael Jordan and Lebron James. The first event connected to the Lebron Experience Centre was entitled Lebron Six Experiences. For its launch, "the art space was transformed into an adaptable space that combined a digitally augmented Lebron coaching exhibit and professional basketball game court in one". Lebron teaches about the six aspects of this game that help him become a very good player: DUNK, STEAL, POST UP, PASS, FADE AWAY, and DRIVE. Spaceships like mechanical cylinders were hung from the ceiling according to the zones and could be elevated or relegated to transform the space into a basketball court or training exhibit. Lowering the cylinders would activate Lebron’s 3D hologram giving a face to face coaching experience to each basketball fan. For the opening ceremony of that event (the night of 6th February), on the external wall of the art space, a huge hall-of-fame was mounted to host six graffiti pieces. Each piece was shaped by a famous Chinese crew. The invited crews were: the Xianggang Fengwei 湘港风味, the FLB CREW, the Kwanyin Clan, the ABS CREW, the BJPZ CREW, and the NGC CREW. The six Lebron’s signature moves (DUNK, STEAL, POST UP, PASS, FADE AWAY, and DRIVE) respectively became the main subjects of their graffiti pieces. The subject of the Kwanyin Clan piece was the "post-up" (tupo 突破). In Chinese, "tupo" literally means "make a breakthrough, break through a defence" so the Kwanyin Clan chose the expression Shiripozhu (With Irresistible Force) as the fil rouge of its work, linking Lebron’s and Du Yu’s stories. However, the connection activated by the Kwanyin Clan concerns not only the meaning of the basket position and the story of this chengyu but also the meaning of the chengyu and the title of the inaugural party of the "Lebron Six Experiences" event. This inaugural party was called Quanliyifu. Quanliyifu is another chengyu which means "go all out, spare no effort". For the Lebron’s party it was translated into English with the phrase "Bring Everything" that can be easily linked to the concept of "with irresistible force" conveyed in the title of the Kwanyin Clan’s work. 
In Shirupozhu, another reference to the concept of arduous and tenacious struggle is in the long calligraphy on the upper right. The calligraphy was written in vertical columns from right to left, following the traditional manner. The content of this calligraphy is a poem entitled "Full River Red" (Man jiang hong 满 江红) composed by Yue Fei 岳飞 (1103-1142), an officer of the Northern Song army. In 1127, when the Northern Song Dynasty came to an end as the Jurchen-Jin conquered northern China and the Song retreated south in the face of their attacks, he opposed the retreat. He continued, however, to serve the emperor of the Southern Song (1127-1279), engaging continuous battles with the Jurchen. He experienced success in his campaign against the Jin in 1140, but the Southern Song Gaozong Emperor (1107-1187) sought to make peace with the Jin, and ordered Yue Fei to withdraw, dashing in one moment all his achievements of ten years. Yue Fei composed a poem entitled Ma jiang hong during one of his victorious campaign against the Jin. In this poem, he describes his strong efforts to recover the lost territory, to fight against the barbarians and to persuade the emperor to support his army. 
The junction between Yue Fei’s brave behavior described in the poem and the "post-up" movement recorded in the graffiti work depends on the four-characters of the chengyu depicted in the centre. In fact, the attitude of a basketball player in a post-up position and of a general while contrasting his enemies is equally characterized by "irresistible force". To post-up the player has to shield his defender behind him with his body so that he can receive the pass with ease; similarly, Yue Fei wants to shield the territories he had reconquered with his army and continue his advance so that he can give them back to the emperor.
As it is in Shanshui PIC and New Style, also in Shirupozhu the mechanism used for quotations has been re-activated. And as in the two works above mentioned, also here the relationship among the "three perfections" is clearly evident and extremely strict. In fact, i) in the long calligraphy, the running script (xingshu 行书), that is characterised by a very "tangled" and tense style, reproduces the tumultuous battles evoked in the poem and the burning passion expressed in its lines. ii) In the charactering painting, that is both a calligraphy in "big characters" (dazi 大字) and a graffiti painting, the burning passion is symbolised by the flames and the red colour, and the tumultuous battles are represented by the inextricable tangle of characters and unintelligible signs. iii) The content of the poem is also recalled by the meaning of the four-character chengyu that is the core of the whole work and of the painted piece. 
The presence of a red inscription on the lower left also suggests the use of red seals in traditional art. In this inscription, Chinese characters and Latin letters are juxtaposed, like in other Kwanyin Clan’s works: the two characters GuanYin 观音 [觀音] are written vertically in xingcao style (xingcao shu 行草书), in the form of a traditional colophon with the signature of the artist (Kwanyin) near the main calligraphy (the four characters shirupozhu); while the four tags of the members of the crew, who were the authors of the artwork (ERICTIN, NAT, YUMI, QUANER), are written horizontally from left to right, as it is in every graffiti piece. Even if in these two lines (vertical and horizontal) the writing systems are different (Chinese characters vs Latin letters), the writing style (of both characters and letters) is identical, so that the two inscriptions seem to be the same thing, merging Chinese and Western traditions into one."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Watching the Sea and Listening to the Waves (观海听涛)" ;
    ns3:description """"Watching the Sea and Listening to the Waves (Guan hai ting tao 观海听涛)" is one of the artworks executed in 2015 by Shao Yan. This artwork was exhibited the same year (May 15 – June 7) at the "Calligraphy and Ceramics Art Exhibition" (Shufa taoci yishu zhan 书法陶瓷艺术展) opened in Suzhou at the Ming Art Museum (Ming meishuguan 明·美术馆). The exhibition, called “Between Squares and Circles” (Fangyuan zhejian方圆之间), featured 60 pieces of calligraphy works carried out by three outstanding young and middle-aged calligraphers in contemporary China: Shao Yan, Li Qiang 李强 and Xu Guixun 徐圭逊. The works, as the title suggests, had to present forms and styles similar to circles and squares. The artwork is a cylindrical “maotong” (帽筒) vase in white porcelain. Shao Yan engraved the four characters on the surface of the vessel and then filled in the blue color. The four characters recall the "bird seal script" (niao zhuan 鸟篆), a kind of artistic script in common use during the late Warring States period (475-221 BC). This script is characterized by gently and intricated curved lines decorated with bird designs. In this work, Shao Yan re-elaborates this script drawing birds and fishes in a naïf style, recalling the acquatic scene evoked by the four characters. 
The work respected the purpose of the exhibition that was not only to show the combination of traditional and modern art, but also to promote Chinese traditional culture. In fact, even though Shao Yan’s work reflected the taste and culture of the present time, it still maintained the true meaning and essence of Chinese characters. """@en ;

    ns3:description """This performance takes place in Zhang Qiang's studio of Chongqing  in May 5th, 2004. Zhang Qiang writes on the body of his female counterpart Chi Wu 赤乌. After being "traced" by Zhang Qiang, the performer Chi Wu (whose real name is Ma Yuanyuan 马媛媛) performs the "sword dance" (jianwu 剑舞), one of the four classical dances used in Chinese opera. While holding the sword, Chi Wu has two red Chinese knots tied to her wrist. Chi Wu's lips are also red, but painted only in the middle, not completely. The performance is accompanied by traditional Chinese music in the background, played with the guqin 古琴 and the guzhen 古筝, two typical Chinese musical instruments.
The sword dance originated from Gansu. It was popular in folk before the period of Emperess Wu 武 (624-705). Then it was introduced to Chang An and became the imperial dance. The sword dance was not only a famous dance, but also had great influence on Chinese poetry and calligraphy art. The poet Du Fu 杜甫 (712-770) for example, ever wrote famous poem related to the dances of the sword dance. It is also said that the calligrapher Zhang Xu 张旭 (fl. 8th century) was enlightened by the sword dance and form his own style. """@en ;

However, as Ding Feifei points out, Yunshu 云书 is a work that Ding Feifei conceived and created together with Zhang Qiang, while Mang shu 盲书 is a work that Zhang Qiang conceived independently, inviting women to work with him. In fact, all materials and techniques used are chosen by Ding Feifei, who thus becomes a full-fledged collaborator and creator of the experimentation.
The performance lasts about half an hour (excluding the preparatory work). During the performance, relaxing background music is played. The music consists on various tracks collected in NetEase Cloud Music (Wangyi yun yinyue 网易云音乐), a freemium music streaming service famous in China. The performance produces three artworks in total (n. 51, 52 and 53)."""@en ;

The female counterpart Zhang Qingzhi 张青枝 is holding and rotating some ceramic objects (of different shapes and sizes) while Zhang Qiang, looking away, writes on the objects with a particular glaze used to decorate ceramics, leaving traces on them. During the performance, the female counterpart freely chooses background music from her mobile phone.  At the end of the performance, the ceramics (about a dozen in total) are donated to the sponsors and organizers of the exhibition, while the remaining part is added to Zhang Qiang's private collection.  On the ceramics there is often  a "red sign", representing the two characters of the name of the female counterpart "青枝" (Qingzhi).

    ns3:description """This installation was created in June 2013 by Zhang Qiang and Lia Wei. After performing a "Biface Graphy" (双面书法) performance, Zhang Qiang and Lia Wei hung for two/three hours the three "traced" long silk scrolls (each 50 meters long) on the top of the Jinshanling Great Wall. Through a long tube made of plastic, the rolls of silk are fixed with a rope and, once hung, there is an automatic system that allows them to open. As Zhang Qiang specified, the silk rolls were left hanging for only a few hours due to complaints from tourists, who considered them a sign of bad luck (white, in this case, is a color associated with funerals).
Some examples of this kind of installations are realized in: 
1) November 2010 at the Xijiang Qianhu Miao Village (Xijiang Qianhu Miao zhai 西江千户苗寨), an ancient village in the Guizhou Province of China, in which the traced silk rolls are dropped off a high cliff; 
2) December 2010 at the Bishan Confucian Temple in Chongqing (Chongqing bi shan wenmiao 重庆璧山文庙);
3) March 2012 at the Venice Arsenale in occasion of the "6th Laguna Art Exhibition" (Di liu jie la gu na yishu da zhan 第六届拉古娜艺术大展);

    ns3:description """This performance is held in Macau in 2021. The artist Wu Xixia 吴析夏 enters in an airtight inflatable sphere that symbolizes the uterus and begins to write inside the “Orchid Pavilion Preface” (Lanting Xu 兰亭序) composed by Wang Xizhi 王羲之 (303–361)  in 353. The Lanting Xu 兰亭序 is known as "the world's largest calligraphy performance" (tianxia di yi xing shu 天下第一行书). During the Wu Xixia writing process, the different forms of the twenty zhi 之 characters present in the poem, which have always been praised and imitated by all Chinese calligraphers, were replaced with visible red ink male phalluses. The zhi 之 character is one of the most important calligraphic symbol in traditional Chinese culture. A lot of calligraphy masters are essentially men, except for a small number of female calligraphers such as, for example, He Xiangning 何香凝 (1878 - 1972). Therefore, in this performance the character zhi 之, as a symbol of order, represents the "authority" (quanwei 权威). The nightgown worn by the artist and the bruises all over her body also represent the state of domestic violence suffered by women from men in history. This performance art is defined by the artist as a "non-literary" work (fei wenxue xing 非文学性) and aims to shake the consciences of people who take part in it. During the writing process, the oxygen inside the sphere is gradually depleted, infusing it with carbon dioxide. Just before suffocating, the artist will ask for help to get out of the sphere. Wu Xixia calls this type of performance “a self-redemption with the aim of suffocating” (yi chang yi zhixi wei mudi de zi wo jiushu 一场以窒息为目的的自我救赎).
Wu Xixia has learned calligraphy from her grandfather since she was a child, and she considers it a great identity and cultural value. Calligraphic rules are determined by ancestors, tradition and authority. The patriarchal symbol of traditional culture has been ingrained in the minds of the Chinese people through ethics, morality and customs for thousands of years, penetrating every corner of society through the mass media, and has been handed down to the present day. The reason for Wu Xixia's choice to rewrite the “Orchid Pavilion Preface” is not only because it is the calligraphic collection that the artist has practiced the most since she was a child, but also because it pays homage to the work “Writing the 'Orchid Pavilion Preface' One Thousand Times” (Chongfu shuxie yi qian bian 'Lantingxu' 重复书写一千 遍 '兰亭序', 1990-1995) realized by Qiu Zhijie.
Another similar performance titled “Writing the Orchid Pavillon for the Second Time” (书写兰亭序第二遍) takes place during the Wuzhen Theater Festival (Wuzhen xiju jie 乌镇戏剧节) on November 27, 2022. In this case, Wu Xixia writes inside an airtight sphere placed in the water. The long snake-shaped strip that surrounds the sphere is an inflatable model that simulates the shape of an umbilical cord, on which are written some idiomatic sentences such as: “chibaole chengde 吃饱了撑的” (restless from overeating); “chi tai bao le 吃太饱了” (eat too full); “huazhong quchong 哗众取宠” (try to please the public with claptrap); “buru zhongtian 不如种田” (it is better to farm); “yishu yi si 艺术已死” (art is dead); “yishu shi laji 艺术是垃圾” (art is rubbish); “hebu shi rou mi 何不食肉糜” (to be oblivious to other people’s plight). 
The writing process of this performance has three main characteristics: 
1) The replacement of the four characters "Zhi hu zhe ye 之乎者也" present in the original text with a "secret" female writing style, defined as "nü shu 女书". 
2) The character ye 也 is replaced with the female vagina symbol. In fact, in oracle bones and bronze inscriptions the original form of "ye 也" is a part of the female body resembling a vagina. As Xu Shen 许慎 (c. 58 – c. 148 BC) calligrapher of the Eastern Han dynasty wrote in his "Shuowen Jiezi 说文解字" (“Explaining Graphs and Analyzing Characters”) the character ye 也 really means "female vagina". 
3) The writing process is combined with the audience's emotional participation in the performance."""@en ;

    ns3:artwork-type <https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55237917> ;
    ns3:description """The installation "Her Mountain" (Ta shan 她山) is held in Beijing in 2021 in occasion of the "Xixia Wu Personal Art Exhibition" (Wu Xixia ge zhan 吴析夏个展 - December 6 to 20, 2021). The artist Wu Xixia creates a "mountain of blood" full of symbols linked to childbirth and the female womb (such as some foetuses lying in red wedges) to talk about gender issues in contemporary society. The form of the entire installation is combined with the Da Henggin Mountain 大横琴山 and Xiao Hengqin Mountain 小横琴山 (two mountain ranges of Hengqin Island, in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province) visible behind the glass windows. Just as gravel collects in a mountain range, women form a "group". The red-flecked stainless steel flowers blooming on "Her-Mountain" represent the "blossoming" of spiritual consciousness. In the installation, there are also the three closed spheres resulting from the three feminist-themed performative works realized bu Wu Xixia. The "mountains" and "spheres" represent respectively the "groups" and "individuals" in the process of awakening the female consciousness. 
The three spheres resulting from the performance are: 
1) "I" (Wo 我, 2020) a work that reconciles personal identity and gender. Wu Xixia carries out a reflection on women and herself, writing the labels of society’s goodwill and malice towards women with red ink, such as "whore" (biao zi 婊子) "old maid" (lao chunu 老处女), "good wife and loving mother" (xian qiliang mu 贤妻良母), "green tea bitch" (luchabiao 绿茶婊), "teenage girl" (yunu 玉女), "white lotus" (bailian hua 白莲花), etc. She answers questions such as: "Who are women? And who am I? Is my gender determined by birth or is it given by society? There is a womb here, but where is the "mother"?". Having been rejected by her family at the time of her birth as a female, she has been questioning her gender throughout her formative years, and the social labels she writes about are an attempt to reconcile herself with her gender identity.
2) "Darling" (2021) in which Wu Xixia performs in front of a building called "Darling". The building was covered with red ribbons, which spread all the way to the inflatable ball. Wu Xixia writes the words "jiu jiu wo 救救我" (help me); "qiuqiu ni 求求你" (I beg you), "bie sha wo 别杀我" (don't kill me); "bie S wo 别S我" (don't fuck me), etc. inside the hermetic sphere. The female body becomes an object of desire and "objectification" under the male gaze. In the process of doing performance art, passers-by, especially men, took photos with various poses and angles nearby. In the course of more than 40 minutes, the artist lay quietly on the ground to receive everyone’s gaze, to begin to write down the words for help. Red gives a signal of judgment, and the red ribbon is the concretization of the female body being stared at. The building covered with red ribbons symbolize the existing and massive examination of the female body. The artist wraps the red ribbon of the building on the inflatable ball, representing the current situation of women who are looking at fearlessly and pursuing physical freedom, but it is still difficult to escape from the scrutiny. In the past, the female body has always been hidden. Nowadays, with the awakening of female consciousness, women break free from the shackles and turn from invisibility to openness and fearless publicity. In this transition, the female body is no longer a private and invisible object, but exposed to the public eye. Just as the protagonist of this performance art puts herself under public scrutiny, it is a challenge, but cannot escape scrutiny. This performance aims to arouse people's attention to the predicament of women breaking free from physical examination (wuwei shenshi 无畏审视). A screen with the photo/video of the performance in progress is also present in the installation.
3) "Writing the Orchid Pavilion Preface One time" (Shuxie Lanting Xu yi bian 书写兰亭序一遍, 2021) which attempts to break the traditional rules of Chinese calligraphy. The characters are written with a brush dipped in black ink and the different forms of the twenty zhi 之 characters present in the traditional poem are replaced with visible red ink male phalluses.
The three independent spheres and the surrounding red mountains complement each other, presenting a utopia in which the "self" (inner world) and the whole (external world) "bloom" in the process of awakening the female consciousness."""@en ;

Wu Xixia and a red humanoid mannequin are kneeling facing each other, covered by a red cloth. When the cloth is lifted, the artist begins to write with a brush the white characters "human" (ren 人) and "art" (yishu 艺术) on the mannequin to "give life" to it, announcing the beginning of the confrontation. To the sound of the drums, the artist "stabs" the mannequin with the brush, leaving traces of white and red ink on the object. Each time Wu Xixia hits the mannequin, laser beams are projected onto the artist's back, until both the mannequin and the artist's body are covered with marks. At that point, the cloth is replaced and the "fall" of both sides (subject and object) marks the end of the confrontation.
The humanoid mannequin is an inanimate object created by industrial civilization and modern technology, while the living person represents humanity, identity, role, creation, etc. The dynamics of the act of "punching each other" through this game of parts represents the confrontation between living and non-living beings. Both sides are kneeling towards each other, in an equal position, just to represent that at the end there is no winner."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Sound Series (声音系列)" ;
    ns3:description """In this series, the formal aspect of calligraphy is only partially considered and the way the space is handled looks quite natural and loose. There is an aesthetic articulation of elements and an overlapping of the characters in the composition (which remembers the performative works but also the more formal ones) but it is not stiff or symmetric. It seems that the artist wants to combine together something formal and something more spontaneous. The title "Sound Series" (Shengyin xilie 声音系列) recalls the sound of the character being repeated over and over. The size and the transparency of the characters are suggesting the intensity of the voice to pronounce the characters or simply the overlapping repetition of the same sound. The reading and the quality of the reading could also be part of the creative process and eventually, of the way one interacts with the artwork. The way the composition is articulated is conceptually and/or visually conceived to suggest how a repeated sound can be represented as it is diffused. There could be many levels. The execution (in painterly terms) is also interesting with its attempt to represent sound through the various subtle tones of black and grey and levels of density in the way ink is used, as in the traditional "ink and wash painting technique" (shuimo 水墨画). The composition is articulate as follows: a layer of larger characters from below getting smaller in the higher part and a second layer of big characters above getting smaller on the way down while overlapping the first layer. There is a diagonal movement suggesting both a certain spontaneity and a sense of tension and again suggesting an informal level of symmetry.
In this series there are a lot of onomatopoeic Chinese characters both in traditional form and in simplified form, such as for example: "ai 唉" (expressing response); "ha 哈" (sound of laughing); "o 哦" (expressing doubt/realization); "ming 鳴" (sound of animals); "ca 嚓" (scraping sound); "pei 呸" (expressing disdain/disapproval); "wa 哇" (sound of crying or vomiting); "a 呵" (interjection of surprise), etc."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Dictionary Series (说文解字系列)" ;
    ns3:description """This series is characterized by the combination of a conceptual approach (as the title “Dictionary Series”, Shuo wen jie zi 说文解字 itself suggests ) with a sophisticated painterly execution. The characters are partly dissolving in the background and they are repeated and overlapping in a composition that reminds also of the representation of a natural landscape or a natural phenomenon. The works emanate a tension in the composition, expressed through the diagonal movement. Conceptually we assume that there has been an inquiry in reference to a dictionary from which certain characters have been selected, studied and re-interpreted with a combination of ink painting techniques. The format is also interesting, not being a typical vertical scroll but one that tends to the square space. The square geometry is also typical of the Chinese and Asian artistic and cultural traditions, but it is less common when it comes to calligraphy as it implies a relevant change in the choice of the articulation of positive and negative space, in the layout of the composition and in the quality of the act of writing. 
The size and shape of a calligraphic work can also suggest more information about the position and the quality of the gestures during the creative process. The materials (quality of paper and choice of brushes) also may suggest further conceptual elements to understand how the action of writing is approached. Here the brush seems to be only one of relatively medium dimensions and the writing style appears to be spontaneous and organized around the diagonal composition. The addition of the red stamps in the middle is another traditional element found in calligraphy practice.
Each vertical-hang scroll is characterised by characters of the same radical, such as “zhi 志" (will); “yi 意" (desire); “bei 悲" (sorrow); "chou 愁" (worry); "yuan 愿" (hope); "yuan 怨" (resentment); "e 恶" (evil)";  "si 思" (think);  "xiang 想" (consider); "nu 怒" (anger), etc., all containing the radical xin "心" (heart). Another vertical-hang scroll is characterised by characters all containing the radical "yan 言" (word), such as "yi 议" (discuss); "shuo 说" (say); "su 诉" (inform); "yu 语" (language); "ci 词" (word), etc. There may be also terms and contents of various types, such as the five elements of Chinese philosophy ( jin-mu-shui-huo-tu 金木水火土), or traditional folk sayings such as "riyue 日月" (sun and moon/time); "fengyu 风雨" (wind and rain/trials and hardships), "quanma 犬马" (dog or horse, which is a term used by courtiers in front of a sovereign to offer their humble service), etc.
Instead of writing poems, songs and aphorisms, Qiu Zhijie decides to copy characters from a dictionary, constantly changing the content of his writing. The words on the sheet of paper, even if they do not form an actual statement, suddenly find meaning because the artist discovers that they belong to the same semantic category, linked to the same radical. For example, "xian 仙" (immortal/celestial being) and "Fo 佛" (Buddha) are both linked to the radical "ren 人" (human being), as for the words "jiliang 伎俩" (trick) and "yulu 伛偻" (humpbacked).  
The artist uses a type of Japanese paper called "zhangzi zhi 障子纸", composed of a protective layer made of stems, reeds and shrubs that resists repeated washing, writing and cleaning the paper several times to create a "layered" effect. While looking at the work, the viewer's eye can abandon the idea of linearity and wander freely at will."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Light Writing Calligraphy Series (光写书法系列)" ;
    ns3:description """This series expressed the artist’s will to re-imagine calligraphic practice through the exploration of different media, here precisely a well-know photographic and performative technique and different contexts. By using the light painting process, Qiu Zhijie maintains the performative elements of the calligraphy practice (the gesture, the immediacy and the text) while expanding the artwork to the new media field. By choosing photography he incorporates a different temporality into the work, introducing a site-specific element (the choice of the location in the public space, which is no more the studio and the night time, which is necessary for light painting) and co-opting a process where light substitutes ink and brush. The timing of the natural gesture of writing is recorded and fixed by and extra-long exposure time of the camera. The final result is a work that, while remaining clearly attached to the idea of calligraphy, can be reproduced in a set and includes a number of different definitions: it is a calligraphic piece, it is a new media piece and it is somehow also a public space intervention, which reminds tags and graffiti although in a fully ephemeral way. The image created can then be distributed through a traditional exhibition, as a photograph, but also as a post in social media, diversifying the virality and accessibility and the way in which the artwork is meant to be presented. The kind of audiences who can access the work is also differentiated compared to the experience of a traditional ink on paper calligraphy piece. The technique of light painting is not new but, due to the increasing quality and reduced size of digital cameras and devices, it has become an intelligent, relatively simple tactical medium to create text-based artworks incorporating public space differently. The light painting techniques most probably used for this artwork are the following two: 
1) Light painting with on camera light source
This technique is achieved using a tripod. You keep your camera in a fixed position, then move your lighting source so it can be seen on camera. By shooting a long exposure, you will see the effects of the light source moving. You can use sparklers, a torch or glow sticks which can be bought quite cheaply. On the more expensive end of the spectrum is specialist light painting LED light sticks. This "on camera" light painting technique will create a smoother image than the Kinetic technique. Swirling, spiralling lines of light being favourites. It also allows you to introduce other elements into your images, such as people or buildings.       
2) Light painting with the light source off camera                                                      As above, this technique uses a tripod. However, rather than showing the light source directly by showing it’s movements, this technique is all about showing the light created but not the source.This is less about lines of light and more about lighting up areas of an otherwise dark scene.To achieve this effect, you would project light into the scene you are photographing – but you would not directly see the source of the light in the image, only the light it produces. Weaving light in and out of trees for instance.
Qiu Zhijie decides to use both Chinese characters and Latin letters to realized the series, then photographing the results, such as in:
1) "Light Writing Calligraphy - The Shape of Time" (Guang xie shufa - Shijian de xingzhuang 光写书法 - 时间的形状) realized in 2006. In these two photographs, Qiu Zhijie writes the sentence "The Shape of Time" both in Chinese characters and Latin letters;
2) "Light Writing Calligraphy - 94 go over" (Guang xie shufa - 94 ge guo qu 94个过去) realized in 2006. In these ten photographs, Qiu Zhijie writes the two characters "guo qu 过去" (Go Over). The artist takes the photographs in a sort of very dark garage, placing a row of clocks that indicate the passing of time;
3) "Light Writing Calligraphy - All Times when Old are Good" (Guang xie shufa - Yiqie shiqu de dou shi meihao de 光写书法 一切逝去的都是美好的) realized in 2009. In this photograph Qiu Zhijie writes with Latin letters the sentence "All Times when Old are Good";
4) "Light Writing Calligraphy - The Twenty-four Poems on Poetry" (Guang xie shu fa - 24 shi pin 光写书法 -  24诗品) realized in 2010, composed by the three photography entitled "Chenzhuo 沉着" (Calm), "Jingshen 精神" (Vigorous) and "Jingjian 劲健 (Strong and Energetic). In these photographs Qiu Zhijie writes the three Chinese characters "Chenzhuo 沉着" (Calm), "Jingshen 精神" (Vigorous) and "Jingjian 劲健 (Strong and Energetic), recalling three poems of the literary work "Twenty-four Poems on Poetry" (Ershisi shipin 二十四诗品) by Sikong Tu 司空图 (837-908), a poet of Tang Dynasty (618-907). Sikong Tu's teaches that poets must perfect themselves internally in order to achieve perfection in what they write.
5) "Light Writing Calligraphy - Untersberg Mountain Series" (Guang xie shufa - Weng de si bo ge shan xilie 光写书法 - 翁德斯伯格山系列) realized in 2007. The Untersberg is the northernmost massif of the Berchtesgaden Alps, a prominent spur straddling the border between Berchtesgaden, Germany and Salzburg, Austria. The series is composed by the twelve photography entitled "Anshi 暗示" (Hint), "Daolu 道路" (Way), "Huiyi 回忆" (Memory), "Jiqing 激情" (Passion), "Kaipi 开辟" (Opening), "Mima 密码" (Cipher), "Shuji 书籍" (Book/Work), "Tanbai 坦白" (Confession), "Tianci 天赐" (Bestowed by Heaven), "Yizhi 意志" (Will), "Yugan 预感" (Premonition) and "Zhenxiang 真相" (Truth).
6) "Light Writing Calligraphy - Changed" (Guang xie shufa - Bianle 光写书法 - 变了) realized in 2006 composed by the five photography entitled: "Bianle - Beijing Lugouqiao 变了- 北京卢沟桥" (Changed - Beijing Marco Polo Bridge); Bianle - Yan'an baota shan 变了- 延安宝塔山 (Changed - Yan'an Pagoda Mountain); "Bianle - Yushu Gesaer Wang 变了-玉树格萨尔王" (Changed - Yushu King Gesaer); "Bianle-Aomen 变了- 澳门" (Changed - Macau) and "Bianle - Beijing gongyuan dadao 变了-北京公园大道" (Changed - Beijing Park Avenue). 
7) "Light Writing Calligraphy: Commemorating Anderson Series" (光写书法：纪念安徒生系列 Guang xie shufa: Jinian Antusheng xilie) realized in 2006 in memory of the Danish writer and poet Hans Christian Anders (1805 - 1875). These series is composed of nine photography entitled: "Commemorating Anderson - I Have Seen Tears in the Emperors Eyes" (Jinian Antusheng - Wo zai huang shang de yanlei li kan dao le yanlei 纪念安徒生 - 我在皇上的眼泪里看到了眼泪), "Commemorating Anderson - I Love Your Heart More than Your Crown" (Jinian Antusheng: Wo ai nin de xinling shengguo nin de huangguan 纪念安徒生 - 我爱您的心灵胜过您的皇冠), "Commemorating Anderson - My Song Sounds Best in the Green Wood" (Jinian Antusheng - Wo de gesheng zai shulin li ting qilai zui mei 纪念安徒生 - 我的歌声在树林里听起来最美), "Commemorating Anderson - Even in a Emperor the Heart is on the left side" (Jinian Antusheng - Jiusuan shige huang shang ta de xinzang ye shi zai zuobian de 纪念安徒生 - 就算是个皇上他的心脏也是在左边的), "Commemorating Anderson - I Can not Built my Nest in the Palace" (Jinian Antusheng: Wo bu neng ba wo de chao jian zai gongdian li 纪念安徒生 - 我不能把我的巢建在宫殿里), "Commemorating Anderson - The Storm Shift the Signs" (Jinian Antusheng - Fengbao ba zhaopai huanle 纪念安徒生 - 风暴把招牌换了), "Commemorating Anderson - Who Was the Luckiest" (Jinian Antusheng - Shei shi zui xingyun de ren 纪念安徒生- 谁是最幸运的人), "Commemorating Anderson - Under the Willow Tree" (Jinian Antusheng - Liushu xia de meng 纪念安徒生 - 柳树下的梦), "Commemorating Anderson - Something" (Jinian Antusheng 纪念安徒生 - 一点成绩);
8) "Light Writing Calligraphy - Twenty-Four Seasons" (Guang shufa - 24 jieqi 光书法 - 24 节气). In Chinese the twenty-four markers of the seasons are known as jieqi 节气 . The traditional Chinese calendar is a lunisolar one. Although the twenty-four seasonal markers are based on the solar calendar, the months are lunar months. Translated into the standard astronomical convention of ecliptic longitude, chunfen 春分(the Spring Equinox) is positioned at zero degrees, and the next marker qingming 清明 (the Clear and Bright) at fifteen degrees. Thus, the subsequent jieqi 节气 are separated by the sun's entry into a sign of the tropical zodiac (fifteen degrees). This system is almost identical with the Gregorian calendar. For example, dongzhi 冬至 (the Winter Solstice) always falls around the 22th of December. This calendar was first utilized four thousand years ago during the Xia dynasty (ca. 2205 B.C. C 1766 B.C.), so it is also called the Xia calendar (xiali 夏历). Starting from the summer of 2005, on the day of each jieqi 节气 , Qiu Zhijie writes the names of the twenty-four terms at different locations. The arrangement and content of this series of twenty-four photographs are pre-determined by the sequence of the twenty-four seasonal markers and the location changes according to his presence. 
9) "Light Writing Calligraphy - 'Heart Sutra' Series" (Guang xie shufa: “Xinjing” xilie) composed of fifty-five photographs with sentences and words extracted from the famous Buddhist text;
10) "Light Writing Calligraphy - Fable" (Guang xie shufa - Yuyan 光写书法 - 寓言), realized in 2005. It consists of three different photography in which Qiu Zhijie writes the word "yuyan 寓言" in different places;
11) "Lighwriting Calligraphy - Forever Night" (Guang xie shufa - Ye weiyang 光写书法 - 夜未央) realized in 2005. It consists of two photographs in which Qiu Zhijie writes the three characters "ye weiyang 夜未央" in different places.
12) "Light Writing Calligraphy - Deep in the Reality" (Xianshi shen chu 光写书法 - 现实深处) realized in 2005. It consists of four photographs in which Qiu Zhijie writes the four characters "Xianshi shen chu 现实深处" (Deep in the Reality) in different places. 
13) "Light Writing Calligraphy - Where" (Guang xie shufa - Where 光写书法 - Where) realized in 2005. In these thirty- five photographs, Qiu Zhijie writes in Latin letters some words and sentence like "Past", "Future", "Listen to Me", Dream", "Be Careful", "I am Fine", "Let it be", "Home", etc.
14) "Light Writing Calligraphy - Dartington" (Guang xie shufa - Da ting dun 光写书法 - 达汀顿) realized in 2005. It consists of three photographs entitled "Shici 诗词" (Poem), "Gui qu 归去" (Back Home) and "Zhiwu 植物 (Plant)" in which Qiu Zhijie writes the three words and sentences in different places. """@en ;

    ns2:title "Wei State of Myriad Beings (魏州万生园)" ;
    ns3:description """In this work Wei Ligang combines figurative elements and Chinese characters using a mixed technique acrylic and ink on a typical light brown xuan paper with rough texture which underlines the paper’s fibers. The classical references to the concept of “myriad of beings” within the historical frame of the warring states is here re-interpreted and re-imagined in a free floating composition. 
The concept of “myriad things” 萬物 (wanwu), which later gains paradigmatic importance in Chinese philosophy, was first introduced in the Laozi and developed in the Zhuangzi. Under the collective heading of “myriad”, “myriad things” encompasses all of the variegated existing entities in the empirical world, while also taking into account the individual particularities of each entity without calling forth any singular or set of qualities, or “essence”, that is shared by all individuals. As a concept that safeguards individual particularities, the use of “myriad things” in the Zhuangzi serves to counterargue against the essentialist tendency to treat “humans 人 (ren)” as a collective of moral agents with a singular and identifiable moral essence. 
The figurative elements and characters carry out a clear calligraphic brushwork touch, which is rendered in a hybrid informal aesthetic register. It can evocate both various styles of illustration, (even comics) and pop culture while maintaining its classical references. The free composition, the color palette and the acrylic/ink technique are the basis elements which help the transition from a traditional to a contemporary language. Particularly the use of acrylic medium in association with ink defines Wei Ligang’s attempt to bridge the gap between strict traditional calligraphy’s rules and modern and post-modernist approach. Acrylic per se allows corrections, retouches and a different time-span of ri-elaboration of the work, while ink confront the artist with its unavoidable immanence and the impossibility to erase or change the marks once they are traced. Perhaps we can say that ink functions at the crossroad between the ‘carpe diem’ of the moment and the event, but it can also record every mark as a trace of each single gesture, as an accurate memory and documentation of what happens from the beginning to the end. On the other side, with acrylic (and also oil) the final work can be planned, changed and re-worked until the final result and it would not be possible (unless using x-rays and complex technologies) to see all the changes and phases. With ink any unwilling gesture should be adapted on the moment, which means one needs to rely on an excellent mastering of his own technique and on the capacity to improvise and adjust in real time whenever a mark does not come out as expected. With acrylic the mindset is different as it is possible to erase or cover a section and start again.  The size of the work is also more typical of a modern or contemporary piece while not being totally strange to certain formats of traditional Chinese landscape painting. 
Displaying the influences of both Western abstraction and the Chinese calligraphic tradition, Wei uses the impulsive gestures of expressionism (in ink that ranges in density from solid black to pale gray) but his characters remain rooted in the square structures that form the basis of calligraphy. Wei trained as a mathematician, and many of his works are based on “Wei Squares,” a formula drawn from the square framework printed on the practice paper used by students of calligraphy."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Shadow of a Qingdao Pine Tree (青岛的松影)" ;
    ns3:description "In this work, Wei Ligang creates an apparently simple image that in fact incorporates a variety of elements: from American abstract expressionism, and the lyrical abstraction and informal art of movements like Tachism ( like Cobra and Gutai). We can detect the “clins d’oeil” at artists such as Jiro Yoshihara, R. Motherwell, F.Kline, A.Tapies. In this work, ink strokes recall a deconstructed interpretation of the character “pine tree” (songying 松影) exemplifying an attitude detached from a strict technical execution and rather developing in a more loose, natural and expressionist way. Another important reference here is that of the “few characters” Japanese calligraphic movement, whose influence has been that of progressively reducing the number of characters in a painting until reaching the format of one single character occupying the space. The mixing of acrylic and ink on a traditional vertical format with a classical poetic-evocative title is a typical example of Wei Ligang’s methodology to create a new form of calligraphy which exists in an intermediate zone of formal and conceptual tension between the past and the present. To compare this approach to an existing western theoretical frame, we could say that it belongs to the realm of post-modernism, according to which the parameters of pure stylistic expression and hierarchic  coherence between the choice of materials, techniques and outcome (typical of the modernist approach) are deliberately abandoned in favor of a more unusual mix of elements that dismantles those same notions of purity and coherence. This creates a further interesting level of ambiguity and complexity ,as we can say that, if Wei Ligang’s works visually seem to reproduce the aesthetic of modernist abstract art, the conceptual root behind his process is much more similar to the post-modern one.

    ns2:title "Quotations from Ouyang Xiu in Mad Cursive A (欧阳修辞抄狂草A)" ;
    ns3:description "With this work, Wei Ligang remains closer to the tradition choosing both a classical reference and a traditional technique and support: ink on xuan paper. The mad cursive script (cao shu 草書) seems an homage to Ouyang Xiu 欧阳修 (1007-1072), one of the eight great masters of Tang (618-907) and Song Dynasty (960–1279). Ouyang Xiu was an excellent intellectual, statesman, magistrate, calligrapher, poet and novelist of the Song Dynasty, whose epic life and achievements are among the most celebrated in Chinese history. Particularly the calligraphic style might resonate with the moment of his life when, banned to Anhui province and living in the countryside, he called himself \"Zuiweng 醉翁\" (Old Drunkard), built a pavilion of that name and wrote an essay about it, which then became one of the most celebrated works of Chinese literature. Echoing that Daoist tradition to celebrate wine and friendship, often associated to the wild cursive calligraphy style, Wei Ligang embeds his work in this lineage. In this large scroll, Wei Ligang let his spontaneous but well-learned gestures flow on five vertical sequences of characters deconstructed into pure lyrical rhythm and juxtaposed through subtle tonal nuances, carefully mastered through the dilution of the ink and the sensibility of the movement. If the piece clearly evocates the spontaneity of the wild-grass style, nevertheless it also shows a deliberate accuracy and attention to showing a broad variety of strokes, an alternation of clean bold marks and more overlapping delicate ones, together with an eloquent mastery of tone. In this work, Wei Ligang tries and establish a dialogue with the tradition of the Literati in which he displays as a \"virtuoso\" his calligraphic knowledge. Even without a certain proof, it is nevertheless possible to suggest that pieces like this one witness his attempt to transform and question calligraphy practice both by subverting and by celebrating some of its classical elements, always walking a thin line between heresy and orthodoxy and alternating lightness and depth. The large dimensions of this work again can be interpreted as a compromise between the large formats of traditional eastern and western art, recalling both large calligraphy scrolls and/or carvings and western abstract expressionism.

    ns2:title "Ten Thousand Birds Startled by the Dawn Drums (万点城鸟惊曙鼓)" ;
    ns3:description """In this work Wei Ligang, at least in part, moves away from any calligraphic register recognizable at first sight, to explore a different kind of composition which looks as if it was informed both by the modernist geometrical abstraction and also by some other figurative imagery and primitive decorative motives. In reality, this operation is part of nearly thirty years of artistic exploration, during which Wei Ligang has been creating a universal abstract language based on the lines and spatial structures of Chinese characters. This language attempts to accommodate the complexity of a variety of western and eastern elements. In his so-called "Wei's Magic Block" he deconstructs Chinese characters and incorporates image elements, tracing back to the origin of pictographs. The choice of the large round canvas and the mixed media technique (ink and acrylic) establishes another parallel between the eastern tradition (in which the round support is a classic choice but mainly on paper and silk) and the work of several western lyrical and geometrical abstract artists. The choice of another eastern classical element, the palette, black on golden-brown, together with the homogeneous thickness of the line contribute to highlight the hybridity of this work, which is then further re-elaborate with reversed colors on xuan paper mounted in the form of a large screen (as in the work "Fluttering Butterflies and Buzzing Bees, a Pleasure Boat and Orchids at Dawn", Die luan feng xuan lan xiao hua ge 蝶乱蜂喧 兰晓画舸, 2016).
This continuous formal re-elaboration of the Chinese calligraphic tradition comes forward as the trade mark of Wei LiGang’s artistic research. As further references to formal and compositional solutions, they can be found in some specific works by Picasso (1881-1973): the series of drawings executed with a continuous, uninterrupted line in a single gesture and the consequent series of drawings with light, in which, precisely to bear witness to this type of apparently spontaneous technique, but in reality possible only thanks to a particular experience of manner, the Albanian photographer Gjon Mili (1904-1984) invents a photographic procedure with very long exposure times and synchronization of flash and dim light, which allows Picasso to exhibit "drawing in the air" recording the final gestures and figures as lines of light. We could also find a visual reference for the shapes and the character of the Nazca Lines, a collection of giant geoglyphs—designs or motifs etched into the ground—located in the Peruvian coastal plain about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Lima, Peru. There are three basic types of Nazca Lines: straight lines, geometric designs and pictorial representations. The Nazca are large environmental artworks only visible from the sky, despite the obvious differences in terms of context, size and technicality. """@en ;

The image shaped in the artwork is the representation of the text written in the calligraphy, entitled “Landscape B”. The poetic sentiments expressed in this poem are shaped with characters rendered nearly solid in form. Compositionally, the work suggests the fragility and sense of renewal implied by the poem.

    ns3:description "This work was made for the 2nd chapter of the autonomously organized event of the Space Regeneration Project, curated by Ren Han in Beijing, Dongba, in 2013. In line with the curatorial statement (which supported two days of informal actions in abandoned or demolished new buildings), this work is meant to witness and evocate the absurdity of gentrification, real estate and financial speculation when articulated by the speed of authoritarian hyper-capitalism. Duct tape is a very typical industrial material that can be found in any construction site and industrial environment; the choice of red is obviously linked to the Chinese tradition of writing with red ink (and even blood) to convey and something urgent and aggressive. The sentence is meant to be the Chinese equivalent of a command with the verb in the imperative mode (Dream!). Since the new slogan had changed from Hu Jingtao’s ‘Harmonious society’ to Xi Jingping’s ‘Chinese Dream’, this action was thought to send a provocative message about the contradiction between the continuity of the unresolved precarity between the government change. The duct tape calligraphic writing was applied in one day and then left there to gradually detach from the wall, while a photographic documentation of the process was collected. The work is an emblematic example of a tactical intervention: it has been done in unauthorized public space, using simple and conceptually accurate materials and conceived in two phases: a physical  one to be executed quickly and gain visibility in the area; a digitally one, as viral documentation on the internet. Red duct tape in the form of writing possesses the directness and energy of the political dazibaos, but also in itself, recalls a powerful materiality, symbolically evocating industrial reality and construction sites, which is intercepted and re-appropriated in this work. In this case the ephemerality of the process is still evocating the philosophical concept of change and immanence, but within the clearly defined socio-political context of exposing the brutality, the destruction and the exploitation carried on by a super-fast, unethical form of development. The work remained on the wall for 3 days before the tape started to detach and it was removed after 5 days. "@en ;

    ns3:description """This performance is realized by Echo Morgan in occasion of the 3rd Edition of the "Territori - Ibiza Performance Art Festival" (17-25 September, 2022) which takes place in Ibiza, Spain. In this performance, Echo Morgan's face is painted white and with a compound made of chlorophyll powder mixed with seawater, she writes "Anatomy de la Posidonia" on her face. She is dressed in white and starts to drip her hair in the compound made of chlorophyll powder mixed with seawater. After dipping her hair, she starts to drip the mixture all over her body and begins to move on a white sheet, about 11 metres long. With various body movements, accompanied by some verses and vocal sounds, the artist becomes a brush and leaves "imprints" and marks of her body's passage on the sheet. 
Many people call chlorophyll "plant blood." This molecule is responsible for the ability of plants to convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis. Through this gestures and body movements, the artist highlights the intelligence of nature and invites the public to re-immerse themselves in nature, giving life to a more "primitive" approach to the surrounding environment. In this performance, Echo Morgan reflects also on the femininity of Posidonia, one of the only plants that flowers and fruits in the sea. Just as a mother provides security, nourishment, and protection to her family, Posidonia provides stability for beaches, serves as a carbon sink, and provides a haven for marine fauna. It filters and oxygenates the water, much like women who organises and purify their homes and communities. Posidonia is also fragile, despite its 100,000 years of strength and wisdom, due to climate change and pollution from tourism. A scar from a large boat in the meadow can take a century to recover. Studies have found that 29% of Posidonia has been lost since 1879. This loss of Posidonia meadows due to human activity highlights the urgent need for greater respect and care for our natural environment and the feminine qualities it represents. It serves as a reflection of the scars that women often bear due to the damaging effects of patriarchy and misogyny. 
As Echo Morgan explained in a recent interview: "The wild and abstract body movements depicted in the hair painting are closely associated with the subject of femininity and freedom - a source of power that also signifies vulnerability and subservience. The painting itself illustrates microscopic images of fertilized Posidonia seeds with eggs. At 100,000 years old, Posidonia is the oldest and largest living organism in the world, serving as one of the greatest sources of oxygen in the Mediterranean. Each square meter of plant generates between 4 and 20 liters of oxygen per day and provides a home to over 400 plant species and 1,000 animal species. Despite being cherished and protected by the local community, commercial developers and tourists often overlook its importance, making it a vulnerable and endangered species. This performance took place in front of the monument of Vara Del Rey - a Spanish war hero born in Ibiza in 1841 and who died during the Spanish-American War in 1898. Through my performance, I aimed to challenge the concept of his heroic status and ask whether he is also seen as a hero in the eyes of Cubans. Drawing inspiration from the Chinese political criminal, Nobel Peace Prize winner, and democracy activist Liu Xiaobo's quote, "Scepter's Terracotta Army. Amazed the entire world. A tomb that is more majestic than the palace. Our long history, relying on the emperor's grave to show off glory," I aimed to shift the focus towards celebrating and protecting other species rather than glorifying colonial rulers.This performance was also inspired by a local Catalan feminist funk band called Pussydonia".
During the Festival, few days before this performance (17th September), Echo Morgan also did another performance on the beach entitled "Echo of Posidonia", where she painted her body white and green and became a Posidonia plant. During the performance, the artist had herself "chained" with 12 heavy metal yacht chains by the audience on the beach and delivered a speech about protecting the marine environment and the culture of the locals. The artist says: "[...] For the echoes of Posidonia, the scarred meadows under the sea. For the millions of refugees adrift in the ocean, some of whom drown in the Mediterranean Sea. For visitors to show more respect for the indigenous culture, Catalan language and their beloved sea".
Echo Morgan has also realised other performances in which she "became brush" and makes use of ink-soaked hair, such as:
1) "I Am A Brush" (2011) at the Royal College of Art of London. This is the first artist's live performance and it lasted three and a half hours until the end of the roll had been reached. In 2011, Xie Rong's decision to return to full-time study and continue her Master of Arts, ended her seven-year marriage. Following the Chinese custom, the mother combs hair and blesses the bride the night before the wedding. Young women often cut their hair and put it in a small bag to give to their loved one. Using hair to make his first live art work was a symbolic reflection of the artist's changing personal life, it is like "cutting" ties with the past, an act of rebirth and separation. During the exhibition “Home” (Jia家) (18th March - 20th April 2017) Xie Rong decides to curate the long "expression" into individual pieces. As a metaphor for endings and beginnings, Xie deems the act of cutting the paper as akin to cutting one’s hair. 
2) "Circle of Fire, the Dying Spite of Yi" (2018) at the Röda Sten Konsthall Gallery of Gothenburg (Sweden). In this performance, Echo Morgan is always dressed in white and paints on a circular sheet of paper with her hair dipped in red ink. She told the story of the Yi minority in Sichuan, where many people died of AIDS, leaving behind a large number of orphans and HIV-positive mothers.
3) "Painting until it becomes Marble - Love Never Dies" (2019) at the Museum of Fine Arts of Leipzig (Germany). Reverently and ceremoniously, the artist stood quietly in the huge empty space with extremely high floor-to-ceiling windows emitting a background of pure light. Dressed all in white, Xie Rong stood with two bowls at her feet, one filled with Chinese black ink and the other with pure blue pigment powder. The artist combed the ink through her long black hair, saturating it and began to paint on a very large paper on the floor. Rong’s barefooted dance began – at first light and graceful like a ballerina, then more intensely, furiously jumping as her drenched hair splattered paint in all directions and on herself. The chaotic calligraphy continued with her head to the floor, making brush strokes. Kneeling with her head down on the paper, submitting to the work in reverence, she made thicker strokes and swirls.

    ns3:description """This performance took place in 2022 at the TJ Boulting Gallery of London during "Love, Celebration and the Road Ahead", a three-day festival (September, 29 - October, 1st ) to mark the launch of Hettie Judah's book entitled "How Not To Exclude Artist Mothers (and other parents)". In this book Hettie Judah explains that for too long, artists have been told that they can't have both motherhood and a successful career. In this polemical volume, critic and campaigner Hettie Judah argues that a paradigm shift is needed within the art world to take account of the needs of artist mothers (and other parents: artist fathers, parents who don't identify with the term "mother", and parents in other sectors of the art world). For this occasion, therefore, the artist Echo Morgan decides to paint her face in white with the Chinese character "ma 妈" (mother). The character "ma 妈" is written in blue/green ink, as well as her clothes are drenched in the same ink. The artist then wraps white lanterns with various writings around her body, combining Chinese characters with the English language, such as: "ziyou 自由" (freedom); "hai 海" (sea); "hao 好" (good); "popo 婆婆" (grandmother); "shengming 生命" (life); "tudi 土地" (soil); "tielian 铁链" (iron chain); "Can be a good mum and a good artist?"; "The Chinese word mum is combined woman 女  + horse 马"; "Flying dress"; "Mothers are the best in the world if you have one you are precious"; "Yellow face wife", "Sea Big Ocean like Mother Care", "Don’t get greedy. Only harvest for as long as you can hold your breath", etc. At some point, the surrounding space becomes dark and the lanterns light up with a yellow light.
Echo Morgan in her performances often uses Chinese characters or their decomposition to send messages related to the female world, social denunciation or to talk about her history, her family, as well as reflections on nature and climate change, such as:  "妇 (Woman) = 女 (Female) + 扫 (Broom), 2016; "Delete" (Shan 删), 2017 ; "Absent" (Quexi 缺席), 2017; "You Have My Blood in You (Ni shenshang liu zhe wo de xue 你身上留着我的血), 2017; "Demolition" (Chai 拆), 2018; "Sea" (Hai 海), 2019; "Human" (Ren 人), 2019; "Disaster (Zai 灾), 2020; "Love Wild Lawn" (Ai Ye Cao 爱野草), 2021."""@en ;

    ns3:description """This performance takes place in Linz (Austria) in 2022 in occasion of the "Performance Festival: Non-fungible Body?" (June, 16 - 19). The artist Echo Morgan, after colouring her body white, writes Chinese characters in red ink all over her body. Chinese words are logographic and their construction often explains their historical meaning. The Chinese word "ta 她"(she/her) is composed of the words "female" + "also". The usage of the word "ta 她" as a female pronoun did not become prevalent until the 1920s, when first introduced by Liu Bannong 刘半农 (1891-1934) for translating western literature purpose. Despite many controversy, the pronoun "ta 她" was an unique and an important symbol during the women’s movement in China. Sadly, there are many Chinese words with the character "nü 女" (female) that contain negative attitude towards to women. These words seem traditionally neutral but embodied the unconsidered misogynistic culture that women are so hunted. For this, Echo Morgan's body becomes a scroll of "patriarchal text" and she decides to cover her body with these kind of words, such as: "jian 奸" (rape); "nuan 奻" (stupid); "jian 姦" (evil); "yao 妖" (demon); "biao 婊"(bitch); "piao 嫖"(brothe); "pin 姘"(mistress); "chang 娼"(whore); "ji 妓"(prostitute); "nu 奴"(slave); "shua 耍"(play); "lan 婪"(greed); "ning 佞"(insincerity); "wang 妄" (foolish); "yu 娱"(entertainment); "xian 嫌"(fedup); "fang 妨"(harm); "ji 嫉" (envy) ; "du 妒" (jealous); "bi 妣" (dead mother); "ban 姅" (miscarriage).  She also covers her body with famous Chinese female saying such as: “Three Obediences and Four Virtues” (san cong si de 三从四德); “A woman's virtue is to have no talent" (nuzi wu cai bian shi de 女子无才便是德); "Men are superior and women are inferior” (nan zun nu bei 男尊女卑); "Beauty leads to disaster/femme fatale” (hongyanhuoshui 红颜祸水), etc. In this performance, the artist also contrasts the female symbol, linguistically associated with insulting or discrediting words (expressed by the Chinese characters written on the artist's body) and the Chinese knot symbol, which has always been linguistically associated with "positive" meanings of union and harmony such as: "jiehun 结婚" (marriage); "jiejiao 结交" (associate); "jieguo 结果" (bear fruit/results); "jieshu 结束" (finish); "tuanjie 团结" (union/solidarity); "jiu jie 揪结" (entangled); "xin jie 心结" (heart knot). After having painted herself, the artist ties her body to red curtains previously installed inside the building where the performance takes place, making sounds and creating different movements with the body. The red curtains represent the "trap" within which the woman's body is a victim of society and patriarchy and from which the artist will symbolically free herself at the end of the performance.
This performance  is part of a chapters series entitled "Jie: Chinese Knot" (Zhongguo jie 中国结) divided into six moments. As Echo Morgan explains, before the invention of writing, people in ancient China tied knots on a rope to memorise important life events. The knotted symbol represents happiness, unity, harmony and prosperity. Ironically, the way the character itself is written also echoes sadness, death and ending. This literal double-bind serves the artist to dive into the story of a woman chained in a doorless shack that went viral on Chinese Social Media in late January 2022. Her tragic case of human trafficking accumulated more than 10 billion views, rivalling those about the Beijing Winter Olympics that took place at the same time. In her performance Echo Morgan engages with this highly mediated incident. By activating the pictorial capacity of a Chinese knot installation, she engages its traditional motif to become an in-between space of social, political and artistic expression.
The other five chapters are:
1) Chinese Knot - Chapter One: Become “Little Plum Blossom” (结 - 第一章 : 变成小花梅);
2) Chinese Knot - Chapter Two: Know her name, remember her name (结 - 第二章 : 知晓她姓名, 牢记她姓名);
3) Chinese Knot - Chapter Four: The Non-interchangeable Body (结 - 第四章 : 不可互换的身体);
4) Chinese Knot - Chapter Five: Red Planet (结 - 第五章 : 红色星球);
5) Chinese Knot - Chapter Six: Viennese Theater (结 - 第六章 : 维也纳剧院)."""@en ;

    ns3:description """This performance took place during the "Festival Perform" of Vertheuil-en-Médoc (France) in August 19, 2022. This is the first official performance by Echo Morgan with her sons, who wear t-shirts with the images of "Tao" and "Zen". Face and body of the artist and her children are written with fluorescent paint protest words in French and Chinese, such as: "droit des femmes"; "pouvoir"; "égalité"; "droits des humains"; "droit queer"; "liberté"; "ren quan 人权" (human rights); "nü quan 女权" (women rights); "dongwu quan 动物权" (animal rights); "zhenxiang 真相" (real situation), etc. The Chinese character "quan 权" (power, right, authority) is composed of two parts: "mu 木" (wood) and "you 又" (again/repetition). It is a powerful and symbolic gesture calling for the balance between man made world and the nature. During this twenty minutes live performance, Echo Morgan with her sons, scomposed the two parts of the character  "quan 权". Echo Morgan composed the first part of the character "mu 木" (wood) by using local died plants, the giant reeds, and attaching her body on it; while her sons carry the other half of the character "you 又" (again/repetition). During the performance Echo Morgan and her two sons start to run, screaming sentences of protest and shouting about human rights, women's rights, animal rights, LGBT rights, etc. All this is accompanied by background voices broadcasting protest news from all over the world. At one point in the performance, Echo Morgan is hit by a jet of water, thus ending her run and starting to break the "mu 木" character she had built, freeing herself from the giant reed. As the artist herself explained, "using locally-sourced giant reed, I created a sculpture in the shape of this character to convey its profound meaning. Throughout the performance, an audio recording played in the background, recounting the history of the word 权 and blending in protest news from around the world calling for various rights such as human, women's, queer, and animal rights. This added social and emotional context to our actions, as we carried the weight of these important issues on our shoulders while running with the sculpture. Towards the end of the performance, I was symbolically attacked with water, representing the brutal treatment that many activists have faced over the years and across the globe. Through this powerful visual and auditory experience, I aimed to highlight the complex and interconnected nature of power, authority, and rights, urging the audience to reflect and take action. The wood-shaped sculpture symbolised the weight of these issues, while our running embodied the urgent need to address them in our society today. Overall, "权 - Rights, Power, and Authority" was a call for a more equitable and just society, using art as a powerful means of expression and activism.
This performance  conveys two main meanings:
1) The artist believes that art should be eco-sustainable. As Echo Morgan herself explains, one life changing her experience was meeting her childhood hero Betsy Damon. As one of the pioneer 1970s eco feminist warrior, Betsy made a promise to herself after a moving land art action - cast two hundred and fifty feet of a dry riverbed with handmade paper. She wrote: “The whole world is patterned by water, yet I know nothing about it.” At that moment, she decided that she will devote her whole life to learn and to protect water. She will only teach art that’s activism and make art that will dissolve in the eco system.
2) The artist speaks about human rights. After the pandemic, a brutal war began in Ukraine, as well as a bloody crackdown on protests in Iran. The artist reflects on all the people who are still struggling to survive, to have love and freedom. She's answering questions like: "How can art be the healing power for the society now?". """@en ;

    ns3:description "This performance took place in 2008, when Sun Ping organized a “subversive” (dianfu xing 颠覆性) calligraphy and a workshop called “I Don’t Know” (Wo bu zhidao 不知道). On this occasion, the calligrapher Sun Ping asked his collaborator Luo Shan 罗姗 to use her vagina to “hold the brush” (zhibi 执笔) and write on paper. The content of this calligraphy is the “Orchid Pavilion Preface” (Lanting Xu 兰亭序) written in 353 by Wang Xizhi (303-361). The “vagina font” calligraphy (“Bi- ti” shufa “Bi- 体” 书法) concepted by Sun Ping 孙平 is a new way of interpreting calligraphy, using a brush specially created to be inserted into the female vagina. This type of brush is made by installing a type of sexual tool on top of the classic Chinese calligraphy brush. The installed mechanism prevents the brush from falling from the lower part of the body during the writing process. Luo Shan inserts the tool into the vagina and writes calligraphy through the movement and the tone of the lower body. When writing, the brush movements produce pleasure. Luo Shan is often half-naked and wears particular masks or costumes, as well as various accessories. "@en ;

    ns3:description """This graffiti was painted on the Moganshan Road in memory of the victims of the fire that destroyed a building on the Jiaozhou Road (Shanghai) in 2010.  So this a memorial artwork. 
The main theme of the piece consists of the words Shanghai 上海 and jianqiang  坚强 (fortify, be strong), which are represented through two different styles of charactering with the intention of emulating the brush stroke through different thicknesses. 
The first two characters "上海" (Shanghai) were painted by Huri in running script (xingshu 行书). The other two characters jianqiang "坚强" (fortify, be strong) were painted by Storm (French writer) in regular script (kaishu 楷书). Because of their uniform thickness, maybe painted using a pasting brush or a paint roller, the "jianqiang 坚强" characters might also call to mind the great seal script (dazhuanshu 大篆书).  Both parts have a thin black outline that grants a tridimensional effect. This artwork is characterized by the presence of some Chinese traditional elements: an incense pot and four yellow chrysanthemums. The incense pot is a symbol of the funeral wake ritual, while the yellow chrysanthemum forms part of the "four nobles" (bamboo, orchid, plum tree and chrysanthemum), which, in traditional Chinese painting, represent the four seasons and the four ages of Man; among these, the chrysanthemum is the symbol of autumn. In the artwork there are also some Western visual elements: a scroll banner, a peace dove (painted in bubble style) and a black funeral ribbon. At the bottom, there are also eight tags: Huri (under the characters 上海), Storm (under the characters 坚强), Ting, Snow, Ake, Reign, Redim and OOPS (in the center).
Among the numerous works of the OOPS crew, Shanghai jianqiang 上海坚强 (Shanghai be strong) is one of the best examples of "contamination" between the Western graffiti art movement and the Chinese artistic and cultural tradition.  """@en ;

In this performance, Sun Ping wears a white t-shirt with the black Chinese character meng 夢 (Dream) written in traditional form. Sun Ping assists his collaborator Luo Shan as she executes calligraphy using a brush dipped in red and black ink inserted inside her vagina. Luo Shan is half naked and wearing a red nightgown and a carnival mask (probably a tribute to the famous Venice carnival). Her movements attempt to reproduce Chinese characters, but finally result in a set of signs and dots. At the end of the performance, all the remaining ink was poured onto the exhibition board. The two artists stretched their hands upwards, in a gesture of sending fuck off."@en ;

    ns3:description "In \"Music Script, Still Night\", Fung Ming Chip combines calligraphy and music. The characters are transformed but it is still possible to recognize them; although the traditional structure of the columns is not respected, the disposal of the characters is from top to bottom and from right to left. Many strokes are replaced by round dots (which do not belong to the category of strokes used in Chinese writing to compose characters) which recall the form of musical notes. Fung Ming Chip realizes this calligraphy while the music resonates in the air, letting himself be inspired by it. The artwork is harmonious and rhythmic, because it precisely follows the rhythm of the music that inspired it."@en ;

    ns3:description "This photograph represents the character \"xin 心\" (heart) made in \"Nüshu 女书\". Artist Jessie Yingying Gong applied LED lights to the body of a dancer who freely performed dance moves. This photograph is part of the Dance Remains Series (舞迹系列) created by the artist Jessie Yingying Gong in 2018, during the six months of the artist residency at the \"Swatch Art Peace Hotel\" in Shanghai. “Dance Remains” is a series of long exposure photographs the artist made of public dancers (both men and women) in various parks around Shanghai in the evening, after asking them to attach LED lights on their bodies while dancing. The artist captured around 80 photographs and in eight of them, the result appears as if dancers are writing an abstract secret language with the movement of their bodies, resembling some characters written in Nüshu 女书, such as \"xin 心 (heart)\"; \"bei 背\" (sadness); \"shui 水\" (water) and \"xiao 小\" (small). This for the artist evokes the times when the female population gathered together to sing songs and do embroidery in the Nüshu village. By combining these photographs with the flowy Nüshu characters, she intends to form a poetic visual compilation of photography and writing."@en ;

    ns3:description """Li Xinmo is dressed in white, and she is sitting in the water in a small pool. She starts writing a love poem entitled "Love Poem Written in Water" using a classical lyric form (ci 词) using vermilion ink on a silk cloth. Traces of the characters, written in traditional form, spread outward in the water. In the end, all that remained on the white silk cloth are stained spots which resembled tears. As the artists specified: "It's a poem that I created before the performance. It was a writing of my feelings about a love that I had experienced, an intimate inner experience. I put a long strip of white yarn in the water and then wrote the poem in vermillion ink, the writing dispersing as I wrote. The poem eventually dissolved in the water. The process of this performance is also an interpretation of love, that it is fickle, sad, uncertain, and impossible to keep. With this work I may be saying goodbye to the love I have experienced before, and to the person I once was".
"Love" is a major theme in literature from the Romantic period, but here Li Xinmo uses contemporary art forms and a specifically Eastern wisdom in order to shed new light on this never-ending topic. The performance is about the feelings of contemporary people, but it has a distinctly Chinese Chan Buddhist feel to it. 
This performance largely recalls that of Zhu Qingsheng "Flute Melodies, Flowing Water, Writing Calligraphy (箫声 · 流 水 · 书写, 1997), where the protagonist of the performance is always the impermeability and evanescence given by the passing of time.

    ns3:description "In this performance, Li Xinmo writes the content of the Fahua Sutra. She spent about a week before the performance to complete a piece of the text. The Swedish Museum invited her to participate in the exhibition \"The Story of Paper\" and at the opening of the exhibition she goes on to finish the rest of the text during the performance. The 30-meters long volume of the Fahua Sutra in her handwriting hanged in the museum space, and she began to write in an ancient ceremony. Ancient people who copied scriptures were called monks and men. She wants to write Scriptures as a replacement for woman, giving rise to a feminist perspective. In her opinion, Buddha is a symbol of the equality of all living beings, but also transcends gender. Reading and writing Buddhist sutras was her early lesson. The interpretation of the universe and everything in the sutras had an important influence on her thoughts. In her opinion, to become a Buddha is to transcend the existing social shaping, knowledge system and integrate with all things, thus connecting the energy field of the universe."@en ;

    ns3:description """In this performance, Li Xinmo sits quietly in a polluted pond, painting with red ink on a piece of white gauze floating on the surface. She writes few characters of natural mountains and rivers, and at the same time she painted these characters into the shape of a landscape, blurring them into a red colour in the water. The stark contrast of the red ink on green algae slowly dissipates into the pond’s water, rendering her painting illegible; the longer she goes on painting the harder her markings are to decipher, a slow, losing battle against the contaminated water’s relentlessness. This piece highlights how industrialisation and commercialisation of the natural environment is leading to its destruction, with the red ink like blood in the toxic water.
As the artist points out: "Black is the most common type of ink colour. However, I chose to use red ink, mainly to reinforce a kind of colour contrast and conflict; the contrast is very strong when it was drawn and written in red on green water. Red also conveys a more dangerous, cruel and disturbing feeling [...]. Water has always been an important theme in my artworks. Probably because I have always painted traditional Chinese ink paintings and have often used water as a metaphor in the Chinese philosophy of Lao Zhuang, as well as in ancient poetry, where there are many descriptions of water. This is why I have a special feeling for mountains and water. Water pollution is also a constant concern for me. So water is my connection with nature and a substance for seeing nature and understanding the world"."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Les poèmes du Mandarin" ;
    ns3:description """In 2009 Fung Ming Chip realized a collection of tableware entitled “Les poèmes du Mandarin” for Hermès.
The collection is composed of 18 Chinese and Western style pieces. This collection was commissioned by the Mandarin Oriental Hotel of Hong Kong that wanted to design a tableware collection for Krug private dining space and decided that all Krug rooms in the world should present a unique appearance and a tableware collection that had an artistic connection with Hong Kong. The Mandarin Oriental Hotel asked the Fu Qiumeng Fine Art to find a brand and an artist that can realize the project. So, it turned to Hermès for the collection of tableware and entrusted the artist Fung Ming Chip for its decoration. Fung Ming Chip decided to write important works of classical poets from Tang and Song Dynasties, such as Li bai 李白 (701-762), Cheng Hao 程颢 (1032-1085) e Du Fu 杜甫 (712-770) about subjects like conviviality, friendship and sharing food and drinks. The artist’s scripts were then carefully interpreted in a monochromatic palette of grey tones to create a sense of movement and water effects on the ceramic. Each artwork was punctuated with small and playful Chinese red stamps or ‘chops’ carved by the artist. The different scales and compositions were matched by the variety of content – full poems to extracts or single characters. The skill and craft of Hermès ateliers or Compagnie des Arts de la Table are on full display in the rendering of the ink, with touches of platinum making it look has it has just been applied, still glistening and wet. The collection has been so successful that it has been launched for retail sail in all the Hermès stores around the world since 2009.

    ns3:description "This performance was held by Li Xinmo in March 2012, during the \"Bald Girls Exhibition\" (tutou ge nu 秃頭戈女) at the Iberia Contemporary Art Space of Beijing. She writes some big traditional characters of the famous Chinese dictionary named \"Shuowen Jiezi 说文解字\" realized by Xu Shen (c. 58 – c. 148 CE). These characters are accompained with their explanations written in smaller size. These big characters with female radical have all a negative meaning, or in any case words that relegate women to a simple \"role\" in society, for example: \"hai 妎\" (jealous/demanding); \"fu 妇\" (woman/wife); \"wang 妄\" (presumptuous/rash); \"lan 婪\" (be greedy); \"fang 妨\" (harm), \"hun 婚\" (married), \"yin 婬\" (lascivious/licentious); \"ning 佞\" (sycophant/toady); \"du 妒\" (jealous/envy);  \"qu 娶\" (take a wife); \"wei 委\" (throw away/cast aside); \"zi 姊\" (older sister) etc.  This performance is very reminiscent of Echo Morgan's “Chinese Knot”. The only difference is that here the canvas is not a body, but a black wall and the characters are not made in red but in white. All of this once again shows the misogynistic and derogatory nature of Chinese cultural tradition towards women."@en ;

    ns3:description """This Visual Artwork was created by Wang Dongling during his visit in the United States.  It is one example among his several innovative collages that integrated Western images with Chinese characters to form a composition expressing a simple concept. This collage consists of a New York Times article on the American dancer and choreographer Martha Graham, and includes also a photo of this legendary dancer. On the English article about the dancer and on his picture, Wang wrote wu 舞, the character for 'dance', in a bold cursive script. The strokes of the character are inspired by Graham's physical posture in motion.
As a backgroud text Wang added smaller, finer orange-red characters in a dozen of vertical lines. As happens in other collages of the artist, the texts he uses are usually poems that he selected as a form of supplementary linguistic commentary to produce a multi-layered work. In this case, the text is inspired to the story of Gongsun daniang 公孫大娘 (Aunt Gongsun), which narrates of a famous sword-dancer of the Tang dynasty, It is said that Zhang Xu (active 710-750) invented his caoshu (cursive script) after watching her dance. This text emphasizes the connection between dance and calligraphy, which both encapsulate the sense of movement and freedom. In these series of works, he combines calligraphy, with the form of the character related to the human form, and also relating the movement of the brush to the movement of the human form. If the brush represents gestural language, he is directly and explicitly exposing that relationship to the body, with the form complementing the movement of the body. 
"Dancing" does not belong to series, but, since the creation of this artwork, Wang has embarked on a whole series of innumerable calligraphic works using art photography in books, magazines and newspapers sheets which, despite the content and the calligraphic forms being different, reflect many of the features presented in the present work.

    ns3:description """The piece was created in the Jinniu District of Lin Xiang Zi, and consists of the large character Qi 氣 (Gas) written in non-simplified form, in a Wild and 3D graffiti style. This character is the tag of the artist: the choice of this character is related to the importance that this word/concept has in Chinese culture. His Chinese tag Qi 氣 is a translation of the word "Gas" and relates to the Chinese cultural concept of "vital energy", "vital force", "material energy", or "simply energy". In the traditional Chinese concept, qi is recognized as da qi 大氣 (great energy or energy of the macrocosm) and xi qi 吸氣 (breath). Originally, the da qi would have descended, giving birth to the earth; so the rain is understood as the "qi of the earth", which, becoming rarefied, would have risen, giving birth to the heaven. The human being, who is between heaven and earth, has both manifestations of da qi: the heavier one forms the body, the lighter one forms the heart. The idea of qi is also connected to another fundamental traditional Chinese concept, that of xing 行 (phase, process). The concept of the wu xing 五行 (five elements, more precisely defined as "the five processes") describes nature as the set of the five elements that compose it (fire, water, metal, wood and earth) and as a consequence of the relationships that occur between them. Referring to these two fundamental concepts of Chinese culture (qi and xing), the artist highlights, in the choice of his very name, how his will is to instil oriental "breath" in his art. The piece has a thick white outline. Every stroke has various layers of colors from dark to light blue, from dark to light purple, from dark to light brown and from dark to light green. The character has two backgrounds: the first is a grey "bubble-cloud", the second is a black wall. This character seems to reproduce a calligraphic seal of contemporary times: like a traditional seal, it is the sign of the artist, and it is characterized by angular strokes.
On the right side of the piece, the tag GAS is reproduced in Latin letters, as well as the tag KB (Kong Boys), a crew from Hong Kong with whom GAS often collaborates. On the left side, there are the two Chinese characters, Hao Qiao 好巧, which represent the tag "How Chill", an artistic-collaborative duo between Gas and SEVE (or SEVEN), a writer of the ABS crew from Beijing.

    ns3:description """This artwork includes ten monumental characters in cursive style displayed on four huge panels. The content is a transcription of a poem by Ruan Ji (210-263) on the grandeur of the Chinese panorama seen from the sky. 
The artwork was exhibited for the first time in August 1987 at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing during his first personal exhibition entitled "Exhibition of Wang Dongling's Calligraphy" (Wang Dongling shufazhan 王冬龄书法展). This artwork was later featured in the "China: 5,000 Years, Innovation and Transformation in the Arts" exhibition opened at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1998.
As described in Barrass ( 2002, p. 166), "Wang would have liked to paint this piece to the sound of Chinese music. but he felt it demanded something more stirring. He finally decided on Dvořák's New World Symphony, playing it at full volume on his recently acquired 'ghetto-blaster' as he took up his huge brush and plunged into the creation of his composition. Wang was amused by the thought that music composed by a European about the American landscape was inspiring a Chinese artist (who at that point had never travelled outside his own country) to create the largest piece of calligraphy ever executed in China." 
In the visual result given by the ten monumental characters of View from Heaven, and in particular in the last character of the verse (from 带), which is projected onto the entire size of the last panel, we notice the influence by one of the currents of Japanese calligraphic art, called Few-characters current (shao zi pai 少字派) and in particular by Inoue Yuichi (井上有一, 1916-1985) on the art of Wang Dongling, who began writing monumental characters in his studio in 1985. The artist was also "inspired by the large characters of Sha Menghai“ (王冬龄创作手机, 2011 page 47). "The work gives the viewers an impression as if they were facing gigantic pieces of cliff inscriptions on the northern mountains. The ten huge characters in Cursive Script exhibit a remarkable vigorand innate solidity and exuberance as if they travelled through eternity, with a cosmic solitude facing heaven and earth alone, as well as a mountain-moving and ocean-filling power.” (Gao Shiming, p. XI).

    ns3:description "“Cursive I” is a contemporary dance choreography performed for the first time on December 1, 2001, at the “National Theater” of Taipei (Taiwan) and then staged again on September 6, 2009, in the same place.  With the study of the dancers and the awareness of their bodies, the choreographer Lin Kwai-min discovers that this type of study went beyond the very concept of dance, outlining itself as a real dance on the aesthetics of calligraphy. It is a journey to explore the body, which contains a set of unique languages never experienced before. The movements of the dancers’ bodies all originate from the inside out, just like calligraphy, which emphasizes the movement of the brush in contact with the air, leaving empty spaces around.  The ten chapters comprising “Cursive I” were performed by twenty-two dancers. They dance in black costumes on a white stage, like ink on rice paper. The female dancers wore black jumpsuits and the male dancers loose black pants that were asymmetrical, with the right leg narrow and the left leg broad. Videos and presentations of traditional calligraphy are projected onto a huge white screen behind the dancers: calligraphies by Wang Xizhi 王羲之 (303–361), Huai Su 怀素 (737–799), Zhang Xu 张旭 (fl. 8th century) and other famous masters of past dynasties are presented to the audience in large scale, merging with the movements of the dancers in the foreground floor. The background music for “Cursive I” was composed by internationally renowned contemporary composer Qu Xiaosong 瞿小松 (b. 1952), and was recorded in Heidelberg, Germany with an ensemble of cellos and percussion, creating a moving tension. Qu Xiaosong leaves a lot of empty space in the musical composition, merging calligraphy and dance into one and unique flow. The first chapter of the performance begins with a single female dancer in the corner of the stage with no music. She dances without fully stretching the torso and limbs. The movement of the body is very slow, concentrated, and precise, giving rise to involuntary physical vibrations, the so-called “qi vibration” (qidong 氣動). In the second chapter, female dancer Zhou Zhangning 周章佞 [Chou Chang-ning] dances in front of a projection of the Chinese character yong 永 (eternal).The yong font contains all the basic variations of brush strokes and gestural vocabularies commonly used in the standard style (kaishu 楷书), cursive style (caoshu草书), and wild cursive style (kuangcao 狂草) in Chinese calligraphy. The order of the movement of the brush serves as a sequential score of the dancer’s movement. She repeatedly writes/dances the yong character with her whole body. The gesture of writing in Chinese calligraphy is the metamorphosis of nature. Yong as the diagram of the foundation of the brushstrokes refers to: “a cloud formation stretching a thousand li; indistinct, but not without form; like a stone falling from a high peak, bouncing and crashing, about to shatter the ground; a withered vine, ten thousand years old; crashing waves or rolling thunder”. During the third chapter, a group of seven dancers vocalize their fast movement amplifying the sound of their breathing without music. The light gradually fades as the dancers continued to vocalize breathing and moving. In the fourth chapter, a male dancer starts dancing at the back of the stage, with a female dancer opposite. At first, they dance in unison, but the female moves by often resting her lower body on the floor, while the male stands in a higher position. The female gradually begins to move towards the male’s territory, dancing in front of him. Both dancers implement sequences of independent movements without physical contact and feed the tension between uniting and keeping apart, echoing the principles of Yin 阴 and Yang 阳, two opposite but interpenetrating parties that cannot live without each other. In the next fifth chapter, a nearly naked male sits on the floor behind a transparent screen with his back to the audience. The projected freeze frame is the beitie 碑帖 (a rubbing of an inscribed script on stone) of the white cursive words on a black background reproducing the poem entitled “Li Sao 離騷” (Encountering Sorrow) realized by Mi fu 米芾 (1051–1107). This is an ancient Chinese poem from the anthology Chuci traditionally attributed to Qu Yuan 屈原 (c. 340 – 278). On the dark stage, the dancers’ skin becomes a surface that absorbs light and reveals the calligraphic characters. As the dancers move their torsos, the characters become “liquid”, flowing over their skin. When the characters touch the dancers’ skin, the characters become brighter. A red circle faded in on the stage while the dancers transited into lower still postures, with the whole stage’s lighting faded out. The ninth chapter is a solo female dance by Chou Chang-ning周章佞. Instead of dancing simultaneously with the projected character, this time Zhou dances in front of the panel placed in the centre of the stage, which portrays the work pan 磐 (hard stone) created by Tong Yang-Tze 董陽孜. The long black dress with 510 cm long sleeves worn by Chou Chang-ning is a reference to the elements of Chinese opera. Zhou begins with her back to the audience, then turns to the audience, which she resonated with the Chinese opera theatrics of liang xiang 亮相 (lit. “strike a pose on the stage”). Zhou moves the heavy long sleeves to evoke weightlessness, like a flying dragon and a dancing phoenix moving like a brush on the soft rice paper. "@en ;

Accompanied by a female musician playing the cello, Pu Lieping reflects on the life drive of man and even more of woman, and introduces the element of dance, through a pregnant dancer who accompanies the notes of a cello played by a female musician. The artist writes the four characters \"Shengming zhi yun 生命之韵\" (Rhythm of Life) both on paper and on the pregnant dancer's white clothes. Through this performance, Pu Lieping tries to interpret Chinese character art through the senses of sight, hearing, and body language."@en ;

The band composed of three guitarists students of the Gulf Coast University of Florida, play the music from the repertoire of George Gershwin and Edward Rizzo.  Pu Lieping writes on a roll of paper with brushes of different sizes and soaked in black ink. The calligraphic lines are almost very thin and "vibrate" to the sound of the music during execution, almost as if they were creating a musical score.
On January 12, 2008 Pu Lieping, the day before the performance, inspired by the music composed by the three students of the Gulf Coast University in Florida, made a preparatory draft on a wrapping paper from the Polo Ralph Lauren brand. The characters, which are broken down and created with a pen, are inspired by the inscriptions on oracle bones. These characters are: shui 水 (water) zhi 止 (to/only) mu 木 (wood) 目 (eye).

    ns3:description """In this performance,  Zhang Huan invites three calligraphers to write words and phrases on his face . He tells them what they should write and to always keep a serious attitude when writing the texts even when his face turns to dark. His face follows the daylight till it slowly darkens. At the end, his identity disappears.
Among these words and phrases, there are also those that have overt cultural or political associations, including four characters on his forehead that refer to a well-known fable often invoked by Mao Zedong entitled: "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountain" (Yu Gong Yi Shan 愚公移山). This traditional Chinese story is known by all common people and it speaks about a family story. It is about determination and challenge: if you really want to do something, then it could really happen. 
Other phrases are about human fate, like a kind of divination. Your eyes, nose, mouth, ears, cheekbone, and moles indicate your future, wealth, sex, disease, etc. Most words derive from the ancient Chinese art of physiognomy, which seeks to map personality traits and divine the future based on one’s facial features. For example, a line of characters marking the location of moles on his loweforehead includes those for "wife" (fu ren 夫人), "prosperity" (lu 禄), "good fortune" (fu 福), and "guest" (keren 客人), while on the bridge of his nose is the character for "auspicious" (ji 吉). But rather than elucidate Zhang’s character and fate, these traditional divinatory marks ultimately obscure his identity beneath a dense layer of culturally conditioned references.
Zhang invoked the primacy of his body as a medium of communication: "The body is the proof of one's identity, so the corporeal self is the most essential component in my works. But the way my body is presented in an artwork and the message it carries is entirely determined by my mind. My objective is to establish the relationship between the body and life". 
Because both his body and mind have been conditioned by his race and his upbringing, Zhang's autonomy as an individual is constantly in danger of being overwhelmed by his heritage. His dilemma is that of all artists: how does one continually redefine oneself and reinvent one's art to escape from mere imitation of past models, or the even more insidious danger of self-imitation, in which an artist merely perpetuates his "brand"?
In 2001, Zhang Huan played the same performance in Shanghai. This performance is entitled "Shanghai Family Tree". In this performance, he posed with two other people – a man and woman – and their faces were also covered by Chinese characters. The meaning of this performance overwhelms the individuality, defining the person’s association with society.
In 2015, Zhang Huan played a new version of this performance entitled "Family Tree 2015" during the live-art exhibition "15 Rooms"  held in the Long Museum of Shanghai. The performance reproduces the writing process of the original 2000 "Family Tree", but, before the writing performance, Zhang Huan had interviewed twelve men and women born after 1990 to study the life and the dreams of this new generation. Zhang Huan useed the answers given by the interviewees to write them on their faces until their faces slowly darken.
"Family Tree" is likely to have been inspired by a work by Qiu Zhijie titled "Writing the ‘Orchid Pavilion Preface’ One Thousand Times" (1990-95). In this work, Qiu copied  the ‘Orchid Pavilion Preface’ over and over again until the small white sheet of paper was completely black. """@en ;

    ns3:description """For the solo exhibition “From Inception: Wang Dongling 60 Years of Calligraphy (从头开始 ——王冬龄书法艺术60年)” Wang Dongling created the digital artwork entitled "Virtual Reality: A carefree excursion" (VR书写《逍遥游》.  Wang Dongling used a full-body motion capture system (全身动作捕捉系统), also called motion capture suit (mo-cap suit), to create a digital work with augmented reality. This wearable device records the body movements of the person, which are converted  into data by the system.  In particular, Wang used motion-capturing gloves to capture the body movement trajectory of his writing.  Gao Lu 高路, Professor of the China Academy of Art, generated several videos adopted different parameters to create videos with different colors and sizes of Wang's calligraphy. 
The writing of this  VR visual artwork is based on the first chapter of Zhuangzi "A Carefree Excursion", written in the artist's typical style, the so-called Entangled Script (luanshu 乱书), in which lines of no more or hardly intelligible characters cross each other in a three-dimensional space . The final rendering in the video is a strong dynamic vision of the text which gives a sense of vitality and movement.

The installation is composed of the huge calligraphy work "A carefree excursion: I" (Yi xie "Xiaoyao you" 一写《逍遥游》, 2003) , mirrors and some screens with videos showing the digital artwork "Virtual Reality: A carefree excursion". The calligraphic work represents the first iconic monumental calligraphy with the transcription of the text "A carefree excursion" by Wang Dongling measuring 7,5 x 12,5 meters. After 2003 Wang Dongling wrote this text several times:
- A Carefree Excursion: I (Yi xie "Xiaoyao you" 一写 《逍遥游》), Ink on Paper, 750cm×1250cm, 2003;
- A Carefree Excursion: II (Er xie "Xiaoyao you" 二写《 逍遥游》) , Ink on Paper, 750cm×1000cm, 2003;
- A Carefree Excursion: III (San xie "Xiaoyao you") 三写《逍遥游》 , Ink on Paper, 730cm×1785cm, 2011;
- A Carefree Excursion (Xiaoyao you《逍遥游》), 365 x 432 cm (in Entangled Script), 2015.

    ns3:description """In this work, EricTin has created a graffiti piece in Chinese characters sprayed on a public wall in a calligraphic form, shaped on a horizontal scroll (hengfu 横幅) and embellished with colophons and traditional decorative patterns. This type of calligraphic scroll is usually composed of three main elements: i) the most important one is the "big characters calligraphy" (dazi shufa 大字书法) in the center of the scroll; ii) other inscriptions and a colophon respectively on the right and left sides written in small characters; iii) the artist’s red seal(s) that balances the composition (for its color and position). The graffiti work Shengongyijiang has the same compositional arrangement: i) the most important element is the piece written in big Chinese characters in the center of the horizontal wall; ii) a poetic inscription and a "colophon" are written in small characters respectively on the right side; iii) lots of tags in different colors and positions balance the whole composition. The graffiti piece in the center is a chengyu 成语, a four-character idiom, inspired by a poem by Zhao Puchu. This chengyu describes the sublime beauty of works of art (e.g., architectural buildings, paintings, etc.) that cannot (only) be created by human capacities and labour. The piece clearly follows the European, and more precisely the German graffiti style and use of color: there is a slight tendency towards wildstyle where the characters are still readable, and a significant use of 3D. The fill-in colors are very simple yet embellished with geometric decorative inlays. The first outline and the thickness of each character are black, the second double outline is red with glow effects, and the final fragmented outline is yellow. The yellow lines suggest the spiral movement of the clouds in the background, which reproduces the yunwen (clouds pattern), a Chinese traditional decorative pattern to which the artist added stylized drips. A dark grey shadow contours the writing and creates a three-dimensional effect through a technique that recalls chiaroscuro. Thus, from a stylistic point of view, this work perfectly imitates the Euro-American graffiti manner, while its composition reproduces the structure of “big character calligraphy” (dazi shufa 大字书法) written on traditional Chinese horizontal handscrolls. This structure is usually composed of a large calligraphy in the middle, a poetic inscription on the right, a colophon on the left, and the artist’s red seals as signatures (Li 2009, 158-71). Shengong yijiang has the same layout: a large Chinese character piece stands out in the centre, with a calligraphic inscription of poetic content on the right, the name of the crew written vertically on the left, and the signatures of the author (EricTin) and the crew tagged all around the central writing. In this work, the strict relationship between calligraphy and poetry is highlighted in the calligraphic inscription on the top-right corner. According to the calligraphic aesthetics principles, the text was written in a style between regular script (kaishu 楷书) and running script (xingshu 行书). The text is the second stanza of a poem entitled "Rouged Lips" by Wang Yucheng (954-1001). The two poems (The Byodo-in Temple by Zhao Puchu and Rouged Lips) have opposite functions: the first is to create a parallel between graffiti art and the other forms of art pervaded by the “divine breath”; the second is to narrate the loneliness and sadness that the artist himself is experiencing, as the crew will shortly afterwards begin to split up. In addition to the use of poems, Chinese characters and calligraphy, a red decorative motif in the bottom-right corner also makes reference to traditional Chinese models. Its outline recalls the swirling and sinuous “turbulent ocean waves” (ping shui 平水) that usually decorated the hem of imperial court robes of the Qing dynasty, while the web of lines within evokes the motif of “vertical waters” (li shui 立水), rising from the deep sea right beneath the waves, composed of zigzagging coloured strips that started from the hemline of the robe. Moreover, the obsessive repetition of tags has the main purpose of balancing Chinese traditional aesthetics with western graffiti culture. With its five different tags, EricTin’s work fits perfectly in the Euro-American graffiti writing tradition, of which the obsessive repetition of tags is a hallmark (Mininno 2008, p. 10). But in writing these tags (three in letters and two in characters), EricTin counterbalances the use of different forms of writing with the aim of balancing the two hemispheres: the three letters of the “TIN” tag are intermingled with Chinese characters, thus creating a visual fusion of Chinese and western cultures. Writing six different individual/crew tags, EricTin links his work to the Euro-American graffiti writing tradition, where obsessive repetition of tags is a hallmark of the whole movement. In writing tags, he pondered the use of Latin letters and Chinese characters in order to balance the two hemispheres. EricTin uses Chinese characters for the tag of the crew (Guanyin 观音) written in simplified characters and in running script on a vertical column in the top-left corner, and also for the shorten tag of the crew (Guan 觀) written in traditional characters and in regular script on the bottom right of the central graffiti piece. Instead, he uses the Latin letters for the extensive tags of the crew "Kwanyin" and of the writer "Erictin" written symmetrically in yellow capital letters below the graffiti piece, one on its bottom right and the other one on its bottom left; and also for the shorten tag of the writer "Tin" written in thick white capital letters on the top-right corner of the central graffiti piece. The "TIN" tag written in Latin capital letters is also intermingled with the big characters of the central piece, thus creating a visual content that shows a real fusion between Chinese and Western cultures and between traditional and modern patterns.

    ns3:description """Brush Array is an ink artwork consisting of four sheets. Each sheet is made of lines of black ink and water. 
The title of this artwork,  Brush Array (Bi zhen tu 笔阵图), refers to the famous treatise on calligraphy "Diagram of the Battle Formation of the Brush" (Bi zhen tu 笔阵图) written by Wei Shuo 卫铄 (Madame Wei) during the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317–420). Her treatise covers the methods and techniques of holding and using the brush and outlines seven basic methods of writing characters with strokes.
Wang Dongling's Brush Array is inextricably linked to the different visual effects shaped by the brush and ink. Evolving from the artist’s earlier practice of traditional calligraphic styles,  Wang Dongling created several artworks focused on modern artistic concepts and without any reference to any recognizable character form,  the artist use abstract lines with great dynamic tension to emphasise the pure expression of subjective images and emotions.
Wang Dongling explores the expressive potential of the brush and the ink on the paper in several series of different abstract artworks, such as Untitled, 1999; Dark (Heaven) and Yellow (Earth), 2005; Being Open and Empty, 2005; Ink Meditation 2005; ect.  These works express the broad spirit of traditional Chinese calligraphy and its essence, manifested through the abstract and expressive potential of the brush, explicitly cited through the title of the work referred to the treatise "Diagram of the Battle Formation of the Brush", is enhanced from a  modern perspective. Large areas of the composition are saturated with several bold, rich, black ink brushstrokes that has been allowed to seep outward, creating dilated neven edges. """@en ;

    ns3:description """This performance by Wang Dongling took place in occasion of Asia Contemporary Art Week (ACAW) on November 7, 2015, at the Brooklyn Museum  and was organized by the museum in collaboration with the INK Studio (an art gallery based in Beijing and New York). Wang Dongling writes the Heart Sutra (Xingjing 心经) , a concise and elegant articulation of the core tenets of Mahayana Buddhism in his Entangled Script” (luan shu 乱书) making the characters mostly unrecognizable. The resulting amorphous and energetic chaos hovers on the brink of legibility, fully realizing the gestural and expressionistic potential of calligraphy. Spotlit at the centre of the museum’s Beaux-Arts Court, Wang Dongling worked on approximately 20 square meters of xuan paper placed on the floor. He chose a brush with a long and narrow bamboo stem, which sensitively translated his every movement. Throughout the performance, he held the brush at an angle and repeatedly let it run dry, causing its hair to split and rub against the paper surface to create tenuous traces. With impeccable timing and technical mastery, he wrote at an even pace for almost exactly 30 minutes, breaking stance after completing each character (268 in total).

Wang Dongling wrote several versions of the Heart Sutra in Entangled Script in his performances, such as:
- in 2012 on the occasion of the performance held at the OCT Contemporary Art Center of Shenzhen;
- in 2016 on the occasion of the performance held at the British Museum in London;
- in 2016 on the occasion of the performance held at the Vancouver Art Gallery in Canada;
- in 2016 on the occasion of the performance held at the Auckland Art Museum in New Zealand."""@en ;

    ns3:description """Offering a unique and inspiring night at the theatre, this concert will combine traditional Chinese calligraphy and modern ballet, featuring a live performance from renowned Chinese calligrapher Li Binquan. Li Binquan has performed all over the world including in such prestigious venues as the Hofburg Palace and Golden Hall in Vienna and at the National Centre for Performing Arts in China. He has collaborated with the National Symphony Orchestra of the Czech Republic, Franz Lehar Orchestra and the China Opera and Dance-Drama Company.
As calligraphy can be seen as visual interpretation of dance on paper, so the movements of a ballet dancer reflect the beauty and aesthetics of calligraphy.

This concert has been organised by the Chinese Calligraphy Association and the Cultural Foreign Exchange Centre of the Chinese Ministry of Culture in co-operation with the Austrian-Chinese Cultural Exchange Association and the Austrian-Chinese Friendship Association.


"In the pieces from Soirees Matinales, the dancers' movements represent the techniques employed by the calligrapher. The Tarantella choreography is inspired by the straight lines, flicking and dabbing of the brush, and the Canzonetta choreography is inspired by the circular technique and the manipulation of the brush by the artist.
The choreography for 'On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring' represents the meditative/flow state the artist experiences when writing calligraphy. We see him pull himself out of society and enter his own world". (Interview 21.12.2023)
There are a total of five dancers composing the Chantry Dance Company: 2 British, 1 Italian, 1 Spanish, 1 Portuguese, respectevely Rae Piper, Louis McMiller, Alessia Lugoboni, Melanie Lopez, Catarina Carvalho."""@en ;

    ns3:chinese-visual-element "Seal" ;
    ns3:description """In January 5, 2015  Wang Dongling  collaborated with Apple to realize this huge calligraphy artwork for the opening of the Apple Store in Hangzhou West Lake in January 2015. The present artwork represents a relevant example of the use of calligraphy for commercial purposes. The huge painting covers the exterior façade of Hangzhou's first and largest-in-Asia (in 2015) Apple retail Store. In the white space around the red iconic Apple logo, the artist wrote one of the two poems entitled "Drinking on West Lake first shine after the rain" by Su Shi 苏轼 (1037-1101), better known as Su Dongpo 苏东坡, an eminent poet of the Song dynasty (960-1279). 
Wang Dongling realized the draft of the work in a lower scale, using brush and ink on paper, and the original calligraphic artwork was used incorporating the Apple logo in the middle as a model to realize the wall adornment of Hangzhou first Apple Store. 
In this work Chinese calligraphy highlights the essence of traditional culture,  linked to poetry, literature and art, the Apple logo is, indeed, synonymous with an American contemporary commercial empire, based on scientific and technological innovation. The fusion between them shows the successful attempt by Wang Dongling and Apple to integrate technology, culture and modern cross-border in Cina today. To make the ultra-modern commercial products of a foreign brand even more attractive to the Chinese consumer, Apple changed to a vivid, red logo for this special occasion because it immediately recalls to mind traditional Chinese seals. The logo interacts with the characters and lines written by Wang Dongling as it is part of the calligraphy. The calligraphic artwork written by the artist praises the rich history of art and culture of the city of Hangzhou, as the poem recalls. In the commercial video, Wang Dongling expresses his happyness "to reach many people by showing them the power of Chinese ideograms."  According to Wang, the poem was the most suitable to praise the essence of ancient Chinese culture of the city of Hangzhou.
After Wang Dongling's contribution, other traditional Chinese arts have been used as the subject of Apple's advertising campaigns in China. """@en ;

    ns3:artwork-type <https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q22669850> ;
    ns3:description """This artwork is part of the Corporeal Calligraphy (Shuti 书体) series composed of eight calligraphies on magazine sheets presented for the first time during the exhibition "Decanter Ink, Hangzhou Cross Year 2011-2012, Wang Dongling Solo Exhibition". The artwork is a clear example of the modernists' approach to the calligraphic material (Iezzi 2014, p. 410). The support is not the traditional sheet of xuan paper, but the page of a magazine written in English with the photograph "Nude on Sand, Ocean, 1936" in black and white by Edward Weston (1886-1958). The photo presents the model Charis Wilson (1914-2009), Weston's partner at the time, naked and lying on the beach. This photograph is the background of Wang Dongling's calligraphy work. The artist distributes the characters of the Heart Sutra in the sandy background carefully following the lines of the female model's body in an attempt to integrate different cultures, represented by the Chinese calligraphy and the Western photography. Wang also attempts to conciliate the dichotomy of tradition, embodied in the Heart sutra, a text of the philosophical tradition used as calligraphic material in all eras, and modernity, expressed with the use of photos and magazine sheets. 
In 2012 Wang Dongling realized a second specific series, entitled Shuti_shu zhi ti (Shuti_Shu zhi ti 书体_书之体). This series consists of five works presenting five naked female models in five different positions, the lines of each body are associated to one specific calligraphic script (regular, semi-cursive, cursive, clerical, small seal). The parellism between script and the models' bodies is explicitely indicated by the title of the work, in which the character 'ti 体' refers both to writing scripts (shuti 书体) and to the body (shenti 身体). Shu zhi ti 书之体 is then understood as 'bodies/styles of writing'."""@en ;

This poem was written around 744 (third year of Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao reign), when Li Bai was in the capital, Chang'an, and was experiencing frustration in his officialdom. This poem was written in a time when his political ideals could not be realized, and therefore the poet was pursuing freedom. """@en ;

I drink alone, no friend with me.

He and my shadow and I make three.

My shadow mimes my capering;
But I'll make merry with them both -
And soon enough it will be Spring.
I sing - the moon moves to and fro.
I dance - my shadow leaps and sways.
Still sober, we exchange our joys.
Drunk - and we'll go our separate ways.
Let's pledge - beyond human ties - to be friends,
And meet where the Silver River ends.

In vain my Shadow follows me here and there.
Together with them for the time I stay
And make merry before spring's spent away.

Next time we'll meet beyond the stars above.

    ns3:description """ "Boundary of Freedom - Chinese Contemporary Ink" is an itinerant exhibition organized by Taihe Art Space. The first three exhibitions of the "Boundary of Freedom" series were hosted by Li Xianting, while the fourth exhibition was hosted by Fan Di'an. For the fifth exhibition, Wang Chunchen served as the Chinese curator, and Adriano Màdaro served as the Italian curator. This series of exhibitions reflects the diverse perspectives and practices within contemporary Chinese ink art.
The Exhibition "Boundary of Freedom - Chinese Contemporary Ink towards Europe" (Ziyou de chidu - Zhongguo dangdai shuimo zouxiang Ouzhou 自由的尺度-中国当代水墨走向欧洲) is the "fifth  round exhibition" of the series "Boundary of Freedom - Chinese Contemporary Ink" and was held in Ca' dei Carraresi, Treviso-Italy, from the 2nd of June 2018 to the 2nd of July 2018. With this exhibition Ca' dei Carraresi served as a venue for cultural exchanges and dialogues, enhancing visitors' understanding of contemporary Chinese ink art within the European context. A total of twenty-eight artists participated in this exhibition, representing various fields of contemporary Chinese ink with a range of artworks, from traditional ink paintings to experimental and multimedia installations.  Artists can be broadly categorized into three groups: i) artists who demonstrate contemporary calligraphic expressions emerging from elements of Chinese culture and art, such as Wang Dongling 王冬龄, Qiu Zhenzhong 邱振中, Zhang Dawo 张大我, and Chen Guangwu 陈光武; ii) artists who blend Eastern ink aesthetics with Western abstract expressionism, such as Ji Zi 姬子, Liu Zijian 刘子建, Zheng Lianjie 郑连杰, and Hou Shanhui 侯珊瑚; iii) artists who derive their contemporary art from Daoist or Zen Buddhist philosophies, such as Fan Zhou 樊洲, Mao Xiaolang 茅小浪, and Hei Gui 黑鬼, reflecting Taihe Art Space's consistent artistic principle of "harmony in diversity, with quality as the priority" (He er bu tong, pinzhi wei shang 和而不同，品质为尚)."""@en ;

This poem was written around 744 (third year of Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao reign), when Li Bai was in the capital, Chang'an. The poet was experiencing frustration in his officialdom, and was pursuing freedom because his political ideals could not be realized.

In this exhibition Wang Nanming introduced the concept of Balls of Characters to the public for the first time. Alongside his artwork, Wang Nanming presented a video providing insights into the origins of the piece and the techniques used in its installation to allow viewers to explore the artistic process and the underlying message.
Following this exhibition, Wang Nanming continued to  experiment the spheres with various arrangements. The artist realized several innovative compositions. For example, he placed them on significant landmarks like the ruins of the Old Summer Palace, adding layers of meaning to his artwork by juxtaposing ancient history with modern artistic expression. Wang Nanming also elaborated and incorporated his "Balls of Characters" into his artistic vision realizing cascading installations and functional furniture to furnish entire rooms (See Iezzi 2014, pp. 463-464)."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Travelers Among Mountains and Streams (溪山行旅图)" ;
    dcterms:description """"Travelers among Mountains and Streams" is a large hanging scroll (ink and light color on silk, 206.3 x 103.3 cm, National Palace Museum, Taipei). The Author of Travelers Among Mountains and Streams is Fan Kuan 范寬 (ca. 950-1032), one of the most important Chinese landscape painters during the Song Dynasty. This painting is considered one of the finest monumental Chinese landscape paintings. It also became a model for later Chinese painters. Fan Kuan based his painting on the Daoist principle of becoming one with nature. The classic Chinese perspective of three planes is evident - near, middle (represented by water and mist), and far. Unlike earlier examples of Chinese landscape art, the grandeur of nature is the main theme, rather than merely providing a backdrop. A packhorse train can barely be seen emerging from a wood at the base of a towering precipice. The painting's style encompasses archaic conventions dating back to the Tang dynasty. The clusters of vegetation at the top of the tall mountain here are actually distant forests clinging to precarious perches. Running along the central axis of the scroll, the central mountain dominates the scene in a classic example of Northern Song monumental landscape painting. The rooftops of a building complex stand out in the right middle-ground. By the cluster of rocks in the right foreground is a path on which a mule train makes its way. A cascade as slender as silk falls from the heights above, culminating in the stream rushing down in eddies towards the foreground. From near to far, Fan Kuan has described with realistic detail the solemn grandeur of a majestic landscape. Fan Kuan rendered the mountains and slopes with jagged outline strokes and filled them with brush dabs like raindrops – techniques that highlight the monumental and eternal features of the mountains. To the right of the mule train, among the leaves, is the signature of Fan Kuan, a final touch by an artist to epitomize the insignificance of humans (including himself) compared to Nature. The signature was discovered by Li Lincan (李霖燦), a scholar at the National Palace Museum in Taipei, on August 5, 1958.

    dcterms:description """"A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" was painted by Wang Ximeng 王希孟 (1096-1119), one of the most renowned court painters of the Northern Song period (960-1126). This painting is one of the largest in Chinese history, and the only Wang’s surviving work. The painter used blue and green mineral colours for decoration, so this genre of painting is known as ‘blue and green landscape’ (qinglü shanshui 青绿山水). This technique was a recognised form of painting as early as the seventh century. The painting, finished by Wang when he was only 18 in 1113, has been described as one of the greatest works of Chinese art. It is in the permanent collection of the Palace Museum in Beijing. The scroll's size is 51.5 by 1191.5 cm. The scenery in the painting was later identified as Mount Lu and Poyang Lake in Jiujiang. Wang Ximeng used typical technique of multiple perspectives, painting mountainous landscapes "naturally separated into six sections by bridges and water". Mountains were described as being "in the style of Southern China"; it can indicate that Wang Ximeng was from that region.

Indeed, they are indeed present in a chengyu used as a wish of happiness, which reads Heqi shengcai 和气生财 (Amiability begets riches).

    ns3:description "This Calli-Writing Unit is composed of two Chinese characters cuju 蹴鞠 (ancient Chinese football, soccer). Yumi used brush and tempera on leather ball to  create an extreme grey and white wildstyle made on commission for Adidas for the 2010 FIFA World Cup advertising campaign. This Calli-Writing Unit is a section of a Taijitu 太极图 painted on a leather football: a curved line divides the ball into two parts and recreates the Taoist symbol par excellence, consisting of the stylized shape of a black and a white fish, intertwining in a whirling embrace. It represents the concept of the Tao (Dao 道), the source of being that regulates the development of the universe through the alternation of two complementary elements: yin 阴, the dark-negative polarity represented by the black fish, and yang 阳, the light-positive polarity represented by the white fish. The two sections of the ball are filled with opposing motifs: this section recalls the Euro-American graffiti tradition and the other the traditional Chinese culture (a taotie), and these intertwine just like Yin and Yang, in a perfect fusion. Since, in the Chinese tradition, football – or cuju 蹴鞠 – evoked a Zen meditative act, we instinctively thought of the image of the Taijitu, consisting of the stylised form of two fish, one white and one black, intertwining with each other, surrounded by the Eight Trigrams. This design formed the basis of the work, to which we then added the zoomorphic image of the taotie, which is a traditional Chinese decorative motif I am particularly fond of. Interestingly, this work is intended to recall the ancient Chinese game of football, cuju (lit. kicking a leather ball). According to FIFA, cuju is the earliest attested form of football in the world, and its invention dates from the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). Initially, it was slightly different from the modern game: there were six holes on each side of the pitch with six goalkeepers, and each team, composed of six players plus the goalkeepers, had to score the highest number of goals. In the Tang dynasty, the holes turned into two goals on opposite sides of the field and the game resembled the current one. The Eight Trigrams are figures composed of three parallel lines, surrounding the Taijitu with a perfect octagon, each aligned to a cardinal point. The lines can be continuous or broken, indicating positive (yang) or negative (yin) polarity respectively. Each trigram corresponds to a natural element or phenomenon (sky, swamp, fire, thunder, wind, water, mountain and earth), and all together they symbolize the contents of the Book of Changes (Yijing), one of the fundamental texts of traditional Chinese knowledge. The wildstyle within one of the two sections of the ball recalls the linearity of the trigrams. Reference to the World Cup in the image is evident: the two sections of the Taijitu ideally represent the two football teams (the yin and the yang) that share and mix on the same pitch (the circle), thus generating a continuous action (the Tao)."@en ;

It is written in vertical columns to be read from right to left and from top to bottom, as is customary in classical Chinese, and is embellished by a pronounced dripping effect, which seems to simulate ink drippings on paper. The calligraphic style (caoshu), the variation of the width of the strokes, the arrangement of the text in vertical columns (from top to bottom), and the reading direction (from right to left) follow the traditional calligraphic manner and recalls the strict rules of Chinese traditional calligraphy, but a widespread ‘dripping’ effect underlines the graffiti taste."@en ;

The use of green recalls another artistic tradition, not Chinese but Western, the tradition of Western realism, based on a steadfast devotion to color truth. At the same time, the various shades of green also remind the greenish patina of ancient \"Chinese bronze vessels\" (qingtongqi 青铜器). According to EricTin: \"The source of inspiration of New Style is ancient Chinese bronze ware\". This is evident not only in the choice of colors, but also in the \"angularity\" of the lettering piece \"patterned with ridges\" that replaces the typical ribbed surface of bronze vessels."@en ;

    ns3:description """This Calli-Writing Unit is a couplet from a poem and is written in xingcao 行草 style, a style of handwriting between the running (xing 行) hand and the cursive (cao草) hand. In fact, it  seems to reproduce running script tending to cursive forms because of the presence of long traits linking successive characters.
The two lines quoted by EricTin are from a poem entitled "On Bamboo" (Zhu 竹). The author of this poem is Zheng Xie 郑燮 (1693-1765), commonly known by his pseudonym as Zheng Banqiao 郑板桥, a famous poet, painter and calligrapher of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). He was particularly able to draw bamboos and his unique technique usually combines painting and calligraphy. According to the content of this poem, in his paintings, the bamboo trunks, stems and leaves are usually lean but strong, so embodying the playfulness and spontaneity of a "man of letters". The couplet by Zheng Xie is paraphrased from the third and fourth lines of another poem composed by the Song poet Xu Tingyun 徐庭筠 (1095-1179) entitled "Ode to Bamboo" (Yong zhu 咏竹).
There are slight differences between the original poem by Zheng Xie and the Kwanyin Clan version. The original couplet is: Wei chutu shi xian you jie ǀ ji lingyun chu shang xuxin 未出土时先有节, 及凌云处尚虚心. So, in the Kwanyin Clan version, i) the fourthcharacter shi 时 (when) has been replaced by the character qian 前 (before); ii) the character ji 及 (and), that is the first character of the second verse, has been delated; iii) before the character chu 处 (place), the character shen 深 (deep) has been added; and iv) the character shang 尚 (esteem) has been replaced by the character zong 总 (always). Despite these differences, the content of the two poems is very similar. Kwanyin Clan probably changed these few characters because they wanted to underline its intention to create a personal style deeply rooted in the past tradition.  Even if there are also some little differences among the three versions of the couplet, all of them focus on the qualities of the perfect literati (junzi) symbolised by the bamboo. The bamboo, in fact, grows straightly and keeps green in winter (wei chutu qian xian you jie 未出土前先有节), which is an indication of its firm and tenacious character; it is hollow inside (wu xin 无心 "without a core"), so it is regarded as "honest and upright" (xu xin 虚心); and even in winter, its leaves rustle in the wind, "reaching the clouds" (lingyun 凌云), while it still stands straight on its deep roots (shenchu zong 深处总), symbolising great modesty (xu xin). The depiction of the bamboos and the transcription of the couplet are two expedients to create a connection between the ancient Chinese literati-painters, who were used to painting bamboo and composing poems on his gentleman qualities, and the contemporary Chinese graffiti writers (such as EricTin and Natuo), who can do exactly the same things (as demonstrated in New Style), but using different modern tools (spray painting on wall). Viewed in this light, also the chain of citations triggered by the couplet is another erudite device to link the past to the present. In this work, the link to the past tradition is also underlined by the simultaneous use of painting, calligraphy, and poetry, the so-called "three perfections" (sanjue).

This is an act of artistic rebellion, a protest against government buffing. After the buffing of the Jingmi Road hall of fame, the government painted a black stencil inscription Qingwu tuya 请勿涂鸦 \"No graffiti\". So, Li Qiuqiu and Corw decided to paint the same text, but using bright colours and fun animations so as to brighten the blank wall that had once been the heart of a shared creativity."@en ;

Shehui 社会 is the name of the brand  linked to the world of skateboarding that Li Qiuqiu founded in 2001 with other friends. The purpose of the brand was promoting events, activities and products connected with spreading this sport in China along with its related cultural industry. 
The two Chinese characters on the right stand out on a background of blue bubbles, the same colour as the tag: the fill-in is light blue, the outline is white, and the depths are blue. The writing style used for the Chinese characters is geometric and reminiscent of “regular script” (kaishu 楷书), an easily intelligible calligraphic style where each stroke is distinct and discernible. All elements are reminiscent of aquatic settings. Thus, through the marine atmosphere, Li Qiuqiu seems to disclose a world in which everything – waves, bubbles, architecture, walls, street art – is fluid and fleeting, while also granting a touch of liveliness to the composition, as we occasionally find in his graffiti."""@en ;

It recalls the underground street culture of New York’s inner city and of Chinese cities, where playing basketball is a way to hang out with friends. The inscription sets out to connect the place where graffiti art was born, the USA, to the place where it is now developing, China, while obviously referencing the sport that is the subject of the commercial advertising requested by Nike. The characters are written in 3D style, the fill-in color is red with beige inlays, decorations and underlines, and the outline is white with dark green depths. This triumph of colors and decorations underlines the sense of light-heartedness with which the piece is imbued. The writing style is rounded and playful, calling to mind the idea of leisure associated with the theme of the graffiti."@en ;

This is an incitement not to be discouraged even in the darkest moments, but to work together to face the immense catastrophe and find the strength to recover. The four characters composing the chengyu fade from red to yellow on a black background, and their style resembles the running or semi-cursive script (xingshu 行书) used in Chinese calligraphy, in which the character strokes are joined together by a single quick stenographic stroke. Its thickness varies constantly, its shapes are rounded, and the beginnings of lines are evident and allow the public to mentally retrace the agitated rhythm of this spray “brushstroke”. Altogether it reproduces the upheaval and brutality of the event. The gestures and poses of the figures portrayed next to the written portion echo the agitation of such moments. "@en ;

He was particularly able to draw bamboos and his unique technique usually combines painting and calligraphy. According to the content of this poem, in his paintings, the bamboo trunks, stems and leaves are usually lean but strong, so embodying the playfulness and spontaneity of a \"man of letters\". The couplet by Zheng Xie is paraphrased from the third and fourth lines of another poem composed by the Song poet Xu Tingyun 徐庭筠 (1095-1179) entitled Ode to Bamboo (Yong zhu 咏竹). "@en ;

Oh, but it is high and very dangerous!  
Such traveling is harder than scaling the blue sky.  
...Until two rulers of this region  
Pushed their way through in the misty ages,  
Forty-eight thousand years had passed  
With nobody arriving across the Qin border.  
And the Great White Mountain, westward, still has only a bird's path  
Up to the summit of Emei Peak --  
Which was broken once by an earthquake and there were brave men lost,  
Just finishing the stone rungs of their ladder toward heaven.  
...High, as on a tall flag, six dragons drive the sun,  
While the river, far below, lashes its twisted course.  
Such height would be hard going for even a yellow crane,  
So pity the poor monkeys who have only paws to use.  
The Mountain of Green Clay is formed of many circles-  
 Each hundred steps, we have to turn nine turns among its mound --  
Panting, we brush Orion and pass the Well Star,  
Then, holding our chests with our hands and sinking to the ground with a groan,  
We wonder if this westward trail will never have an end.  
The formidable path ahead grows darker, darker still,  
With nothing heard but the call of birds hemmed in by the ancient forest,  
Male birds smoothly wheeling, following the females;  
And there come to us the melancholy voices of the cuckoos  
Out on the empty mountain, under the lonely moon....  
Such traveling is harder than scaling the blue sky.  
Even to hear of it turns the cheek pale,  
With the highest crag barely a foot below heaven.  
Dry pines hang, head down, from the face of the cliffs,  
And a thousand plunging cataracts outroar one another  
And send through ten thousand valleys a thunder of spinning stones.  
With all this danger upon danger,  
Why do people come here who live at a safe distance?  
...Though Dagger-Tower Pass be firm and grim,  
And while one man guards it  
Ten thousand cannot force it,  
What if he be not loyal,  
But a wolf toward his fellows?  
...There are ravenous tigers to fear in the day  
And venomous reptiles in the night  
With their teeth and their fangs ready  
To cut people down like hemp.  
Though the City of Silk be delectable, I would rather turn home quickly.  
Such traveling is harder than scaling the blue sky....  
But I still face westward with a dreary moan.

    ns3:description """Background: In 755 AD, a rebellion against the government led to the abdication of Emperor Xuanzong. Li Bai, a renowned poet at the time, sided with Prince Lin, the emperor’s 16th son, who fought for the throne. However, after Lin was defeated and executed, Li Bai was exiled to Yelang. A year later, when Emperor Xuanzong died, Li Bai was pardoned. Thus, Li Bai wrote this poem when he was sailing back home on the Yangtze River, finally released from his exile.
Interpretation: The tone of this poem is carefree and optimistic, depicting Li Bai’s happiness as he departs from his place of exile. 
Whereas clouds are typically gray and represent a rainy or foggy day, the imagery of rosy clouds at dawn sets a glowing and beautiful atmosphere. The juxtaposition of the words “千” (thousand) and “一” (one) also reveals Li Bai’s enthusiasm: instead of focusing on on the thousands of meters it will take to reach his destination, he emphasizes the short length of time it will take for him to return. Furthermore, the apes, which signify his adversaries, call out endlessly and attempt to stop him on his path back home; however, he appears unaffected by the chaos and noise — his light boat easily passes through the two shores. The term “轻” not only signifies the lightness of his boat, but also represents his light-hearted feelings as he leaves behind the ten-thousand layers of mountains, the burdens of his past.""" ;

Curator Tong Yang-Tze invites diverse and talented fashion designers of Chinese ethnicity to participate, create, and accumulate design context inspired by the calligraphy lines. “From Ink to Apparel III” stays true to its history of crossover collaborations and its exploration into calligraphy’s role in contemporary art. The exhibition theme is “wú” and features three designers from Taiwan, two from Beijing and one from UK: CHOU Yu-Ying, CHEN Shao-Yen, TSAI Yi-Fen, LI Ying-Jun, ZHOU You, and PAN Bernice.Their exhibits will showcase thirty collections that illustrate the unique style and energy of each designer.
“Wú”  無 (emptiness) is the theme of this exhibition, with fourteen fonts which are variations of the Cursive Script, Running Script, Regular Script, Clerical Script, and Seal Script. The forms of these characters are distinct, but designers must interpret them visually to form structures, materials, and prints from the fluidity of calligraphy lines and the spaces amongst them."""@en,

These fonts are variations of the cursive script, running script, regular script, clerical script, and seal script.  Lacework and beaded embroideries replace the traces of the brush. 
In Chinese philosophy, “wu” means emptiness. Tong Yang-tze underlines the broadness of the concept of “wu”, noting that her interpretation of the character results from the connotation of “without limits, without end.” She explains that “‘wu’ is the ground, ‘you’ 有 (the opposite of wu) is the sky. Since there is a ground there can be an endless stream of ideas. Like the ‘ground’ [in the literal sense], it provides the capability to bear a load and create.”

In the second photograph entitled "1/2 Text", the body and the face of the artist are completely covered by Chinese characters, so that Zhang Huan's ethnicity is literally inscribed on his body. In the third photograph entitled "1/2 Meat + Text",  Zhang Huan 'wears' again the carcass of the raw bovine meat, but this time his  body is completely covered by written characters. 
To realize Chinese characters on the artist's body, his friend used traditional calligraphic tools, like brush and ink, and the support for their calligraphies is the artist's body instead of paper. The chromatism of these photographs also recalls traditional calligraphy: the black of the ink, and the white and red of the carcass that recalls white paper and  red seal(s).

These four characters form a popular auspicious phrase that means "Good fortune, long life and happiness". Each character is placed on a single panel; the four panels are next to one another, and the four characters are read from right to left as usual in traditional Chinese calligraphy. In this work, Fan Sack was probably inspired by the big signs written from right to left in Chinese calligraphy on temples or public buildings.
The artwork is made exactly like a calligraphy: (1) its format recalls the "big character calligraphy" (dazi shufa 大字书法) of classical tradition; (2) the artist seeks to reproduce brush strokes on paper using a paint roller and a brush; (3) the calligraphic script seems to reproduce regular script (kaishu 楷书), and the links between certain strokes of the characters recall running script (xingshu 行书).
In contrast to traditional calligraphy, which is always monochrome (black ink on white paper), in this work each character is painted a different colour and has a colourful kaleidoscopic circle in the background that gives tridimensionality and power to each character."""@en ;

    ns3:description """This artwork  was originally part of a series entitled "Yishi de wangchao 遗失的王朝" (The Mythos of Lost Dynasties Series, 1983-1998). In this series,  Gu Wenda invents a new form of writing, based on the ancient seal-script characters, but these new characters are meaningless. Exploring the loss of meaning of writing, Gu Wenda reduces writing to a mere sign.
Chang shen 畅神 was exhibited for the first time in 1985 during  a group exhibition entitled "Hubei guohua xinzuo yaoqing zhan 湖北国华新作请展 (Group Exhibition of the New Traditional Painting of Hubei Province)", held at the Wushang Exhibition Center in the city of Wushang. On that occasion,  the work was presented as part of a series entitled "Mythos of Lost Dynasties - Tranquility Comes from Meditation" (遗失的王朝 - 静观的世界 Yishi de wangchao  - Jingguan de shijie) composed of five oversize hanging scrolls. These five artworks then have become part of the series entitled "Pseudo-characters Series" (Xugou wenzi xilie 虚构文字系列).
Chang shen 畅 神 is composed of a single invented ideograph suspended over a landscape. The full ideograph is unreadable, but the three cursive-script components (yi 易, shen 申, shi 示 ) may be interpreted as the character for “unobstructed” (chang 畅 ) and that for “spirit” (shen 神). While Gu’s overriding purpose may have been to subvert the semantic function of calligraphy, his creation of a “new” symbol embodying the notion of an unfettered spirit is a powerful emblem of his wish to escape cultural stereotypes.

    ns3:description "This artwork is the final result of the performance entitled \"Writing the 'Orchid Pavilion Preface' One Thousand Times\" (重复书写一千遍 '兰亭序'). In this performance, Qiu Zhijie decides to devote himself to copying the work \"Lanting xu 兰亭序\" (Orchid Pavilion Preface) composed by Wang Xizhi in 353 AD. Qiu Zhijie repeatedly copies the work a thousand times on the same piece of rice papersheet. Repeatedly writing over his free-hand interpretation of the original, Qiu turns the paper into a saturated black field. By focusing on the process of writing rather than on its literary content, Qiu asserts that the ultimate goal of calligraphic practice is a form of \"written meditation\"."@en ;

The two characters qing 晴 (“bright”), whose edges look like carved wood signs, and xue 雪 (“snow”), fat and thick with a firm central part, represent a surprising contrast just like the sunlight that spreads with roar over the silent snow. For both characters, Shao Yan adopts the “flying white” (feibai飞白) technique, which means using the half-dry brush, in order to represent the wild landscape of Northern China struck by violent snowstorms. The little inscription is written with brushstrokes full of ink and it has an angular shape, balancing the entire calligraphy. "@en ;

It is composed by two opposing heavy vertical lines that incline from upper left to lower right, framing the artwork, and two horizontal lines that continue beyond the edge of the paper and appear cropped or abbreviated. Inside the frame, the first two horizontal lines are executed in centered-tip brushwork with “flying white” technique while the two horizontal lines in the lower part of the work are drown with moist ink, spread toward the right and merge in a more heavy stroke. In the upper part of the work Shao Yan executes a vertical line that parallels the two lines framing the work and another one to the right side that inclines from left to right. In the lower part he brushes a short and thick vertical line placed off-centerd (compared with the central position it takes in the character “wei”). In the middle part Shao Yan executes the element “口”, in a trapezoidal shape rather than in the original square shape. This element works with the four lines of the frame to balance the entire work. Although the outlines of this work seem to represent an ancient city wall where people are forced to live, the reference to reality is minimal and the work tends towards abstraction. "@en ;

Shao Yan pays particular attention to the spacial order and the composition of the character but, introducing the element of water, he adds the concept of time to the construction of calligraphic space.

    ns3:description """This CWU is part of the artwork “Army" (Jun 军), executed in 2003 by Shao Yan. Influenced by Western analythical cubism, the artist modifies the original structure of the character preventing its identification, denies the concept of classical perspective and destroying the calligraphic space, breaking it up and reorganising it into simple geometric shapes such as triangles and polygons.
In “Jun” the geometric structure is concentrated on the central line while the outermost part, towards the edge, is more airy and open. Shao Yan thus wants to emphasise the layering and light effect produced by the geometric cut. The material structure is dominated by the geometric appearance of the lines that gather into inclined angular planes, and the straight lines and oblique planes suggest the changing position of the Chinese character structure. Shao Yan executed the character using ink 'washed' with water, which, unlike Western oil painting, softens the geometric deconstruction of the character structure."""@en ;

The entire inscription is one foot square in diameter. It is a precious treasure of calligraphy art in Weifang.
The technique of rubbing consists in applying a sheet of paper with longer and more resisting fibers to the rocky surface of a cliff, stele or even small seal stone, to then ink the sheet, and take a life-size copy of the rubbed surface. An inversion in the perception of relief and shade takes place when intaglio lines become white, and relief parts, black. Obviously, while deep intaglio is totally white and high relief, black, there is a whole realm of in-betweenness where the middle grounds, low relief and smooth concavities can only be expressed in shades of grey. Rubbing is thus extremely interpretative and is a form of indirect perception, comparable to photography.

    ns3:description """This artwork is a fragment of a rubbing inscription entitled "Stele of An Gong (An Gong zhi bei 安公之牌)" realized by the monk Seng' An Daoyi 安道壹 during the Northern Qi Dynasty (550–577).
The "Stele of An Gong" is one of the total 23 inscriptions found on the Northern cliff at Mount Hongding, in the north bank of Dongping Lake (Shangdong Province). 
The structure of Seng An’s characters, the calligraphic strokes and their technical execution in stone, as well as the monumental dimensions of the inscriptions are all elements which find no comparison in contemporaneous calligraphic production, under the Northern Qi Dynasty (550-577). The content of his epigraphy does not match contemporaneous mainstream religious texts or imagery. The sites that Seng' An marked are located in a peripheral area with respects to the imperial capital city of the time, Ye 鄴, in mountainous fringes neighbouring important pre-existing sacred sites such as Mount Tai 泰山. Unlike any known early epigrapher, Seng' An Daoyi carved directly on the raw, undressed stone surface, merging the shape of the text with the pre-existing shapes of nature. The characters follow or avoid folds and cracks, and they are animated by the movement of the water.
Seng An Daoyi extracted meaning from the sūtras, in the form of fragmentary passages, names and isolated sounds, creating his own esoteric dictionary. We also find complete inventions such as the mountain Buddha names, personal statements, and liberties taken in translation and in transcription. In a movement ‘from text to language’, Seng' An Daoyi extracted meaning from chosen sections of the sūtras, repeating this selection of fragmentary passages from one site to another, and mimicking the logical structure of sūtras in word games of his own. Bridging text to the mountain, Seng' An Daoyi builds up a chain of transformations, where, through the stele format, language is revisited, transcended, deconstructed and re-assembled. Going further into the language, and taking advantage of a supplementary level of language offered by the Chinese script, Seng' An Daoyi uses the format of names and the obvious anthropomorphic aspects of identification to bring calligraphy beyond the very structure of Chinese characters.
The technique of rubbing consists in applying a sheet of paper with longer and more resisting fibers to the rocky surface of a cliff, stele or even small seal stone, to then ink the sheet, and take a life-size copy of the rubbed surface. An inversion in the perception of relief and shade takes place when intaglio lines become white, and relief parts, black. Obviously, while deep intaglio is totally white and high relief, black, there is a whole realm of in-betweenness where the middle grounds, low relief and smooth concavities can only be expressed in shades of grey. Rubbing is thus extremely interpretative and is a form of indirect perception, comparable to photography."""@en ;

    ns3:description """This CWU is part of the work “Peach blossoms fall in a chaotic rain of red dust”. This is an "artwork with more characters” (duozishu chuangzuo 多字数创作) executed by Shao Yan in 1995.  It is characterised by a huge variation in the thickness of the lines and by words that seem to radiate from the centre of the work and to continue beyond the paper’s edge. The words are executed in an original cursive form, achieved by frequently changing the speed and direction of the brush until the characters become almost unreadable, in order to emphasise the harmony and movement of the lines. 
Shao Yan executed the characters taohua luanluo hongchengyu 桃花乱落红尘雨 in cursive style and placed them vertically on the paper to call to the viewer's mind the poetic image of the falling peach blossom and they are composed by horizontal lines and dots that cover the work and recall the lines of a score embellished with musical notes. This creates a perfect union between the spatial structure of Chinese characters and the temporal rhythm, which reminds of the crackling red rain.
Shao Yan borrowed from the poem “Invitation to Wine” (Jiangjinjiu 将进酒) by Li He 李贺 (790-816) the expression "like red rain" (ruhongyu 如红雨) and transformed it into "rain of red dust" (hongchenyu 红尘雨), inserting the character chen 尘 ("dust" ) between the character hong 红 ("red") and yu 雨 ("rain"), whose structure is made of a continuous motion of inextricable lines to balance the work. The characters "chen" and "yu" work in concert with the characters hua 花 (“flower”) and luan 乱 ("chaotic”) to mirror the scene of peach blossoms sliding down like rainwater.
The characters are executed not only with a usual brush but also with doubi 斗笔 (a large brush with the tip mounted on the final part of the bucket-shaped handle). 
With this artwork, Shao Yan does not want to reproduce the meaningful forms of the characters but wants to convey to the observer the feeling evoked by the poetic verses.

    ns3:description "This CWU is part of the artwork “Flying Good Luck” executed in 2011 by Shao Yan. For this work, he used a long and sharp brush, which he dipped in thick ink to execute the characters in cursive script. With a series of sharp strokes on the paper, changes of direction, arching and lifting the brush, Shao Yan brushed the first two characters, fei 飞 (“to fly”) and lai 来 (“to come”), from the upper part toward the lower part of the work. At this point, he dipped the brush in a small amount of ink, lifted it up, quickly drawing in the air a semi-circular arc and scattering dots of ink in order to give life to the character hao 好 (“Good”). To execute the character yun 运 (“Luck”) he used the paibi 排笔 (a brush composed of small brushes joined together) tilted at a 45-degree angle and loaded with ink. The form of the characters evokes the image of a boat carried by the wind: the oblique part of the character \"yun\" 云 recalls the prow of the boat hit by the splashing waves, the vertical strokes of \"yun\" 云, \"lai\" 来 and \"hao\" 好 symbolize the mast of the boat and the ink splashes represent the sails rolled up by the wind."@en ;

This CWU is Shao Yan's first experiment using a syringe of ink instead of a brush, the so called “ink shooting” (shemo 射墨) to write lines without meaning. The thick ink, squirting out of the syringe toward the paper, reminds of blood and the artist's life is the force that drives the tool. The entire artistic process is characterized by the force of the syringe, the force of gravity, the speed of the jet and the direction that create numerous ink marks of multiple shapes. Through this early experiment with the syringe, Shao Yan was amazed by the fan-like shapes that the ink, hurled at high speed like a projectile, formed on the paper, and this expedient enabled him to produce different shapes of lines and marks."""@en ;

This is the first time Zhang Qiang experiences writing on human body. The woman Li Ensu is wearing only a swimsuit and Zhang Qiang covers her swimsuit and body with black ink traces, turning his back to the subject.

The central part of the work is executed with a dry brush that creates the shapes of the cracks. Both '幺' elements of the character tilt and succumb together with the entire structure.

    ns2:title "Biface Graphy (双面书法)" ;
    ns3:description """"Biface Graphy" is a calligraphic project realized by Zhang Qiang and Lia Wei.  The project declines itself in various fields : monumental landscape and installation, cave shrinerubbing sessions and dialogue books, etc. By choosing the Literati world as a common form of life, the two artists established practice, metaphysical behavior and research fields as an interconnected whole.
Biface Calligraphy appears to be the most efficient way to federate interests in a synthetic, immediate, absolute movement.  Early Biface Graphy is made of strategic moves, definite purpose, graphic choices. During its latest progress, the artists' practice gained in fluidity and spontaneity. This performative tool allows each artist to distinct himself behind a paper-sheet distance from the other, but it also provokes and melts their most instinctive actions in a visual, spatial, temporal continuum. The 'Machine' and the running Scroll constitute their frame of interaction. By multiplying the machine's versions and experimenting different qualities of writing support, Zhang Qiang and Lia Wei regulate Biface graphy's physical shape. The resulting patterns are a visual translation of their common discourse and become an apparition by 'Open Scroll' happenings. Sudden vertical "discursive shapes" spread thereby in landscapes and cities.

In "Biface Graphy" writing sessions, a scroll hangs vertically in-between the two artists Zhang Qiang and Lia Wei. The brushes thus not having to compete for a same surface, each one being able to freely occupy a whole side of the paper. The script is realized with calligraphic brushes and ink; it is not readable, but constructed through the interaction of the two brushes writing simultaneously, conscious of each other’s movement.
The ‘Biface Graphy’ studio gradually became more structured. The scroll was suspended in space on a permanent standing man-sized frame. The writers are facing each other, standing on platforms under which the translucent scroll can run ‘endlessly’, without preventing their movement and the running script. The writing surface is sensitive to movement; brushes are thus not acting on a flat surface. The flexible surface is sensitive to pressure on both sides and convey the strength and darker spots of encounter as well as the depth of one-sided gestures. The wooden structure where Biface Graphy was produced was meant as an abstract machine producing its own intrinsic language. Here, content and shape are not opposed, but the trace produced is beyond expression, beyond signs. Rather, it takes shape directly from the hand-and- tool polarity. The scroll’s structure allows artists' writing process to rely on uninterrupted gesture, letting hands lead our minds. By choosing translucent silk, the two artists want to suspend the strokes and allow them to conquer space. 
In the long term, as the project extends over several years, the interaction between the two calligraphers gained in depth and finesse and a common language was approached, in an asymptotic fashion. This secret language proceeded by a constant and formed its own subsystem, fed by the existing system of variation provided by calligraphic shapes. An essential difference between Biface Graphy and traditional calligraphy is of course the unreadable quality of the script. Chinese calligraphers make up a mental image of the graph to come and its position in the pictorial space before the act of writing, while "Biface
Graphy" relies on a prior contract between two authors. Such contract is closer to exercises ofspirit writing, divination or forms of talismanic writing, than to historically contingent ideographic writing. In the divination process, there is a question, an answer, and a third part that is played by nature’s entropic processes. To our eyes, the braid-like structure of Biface Graphy was eminently recognizable. But at first sight, without being backed up by an apparent writing process, the scrolls risked to appear as any abstract ink painting. 
A second step taken by the collaborative duo was to spatialize the resulting scrolls in their full scale. Through a series of installations which we called ‘Open Scroll‘, Biface Graphy exit the literati’s studio enclosed universe and invaded man-made architectures and open air landscapes.
Hundreds of meters of soft silken scrolls were displayed outdoors, far from the two-dimensional surface of traditional calligraphy. To this day, scrolls have been opened in Xijiang village (Guizhou province 2011), Bishan Temple of Confucius (Chongqing Municipality 2011), Mount Taihang in Linzhou (Henan province 2012), Great Wall at Jinshangling (Hebei province 2013), as well as several traditional exhibition spaces (Chengdu Biennale, China Academy of Art, Venice Arsenale, Venice Lido Gran Viale, Brussels Palais de Justice, Paris Buttes-Chaumont, Venice Magazzino del Sale, etc.).

"On 11 september 2009 at home in Chongqing, looking at some exercises of recto-verso writing in archaic logograms, we were seduced by their complex structure and ink variation. Conjunction in space awaited for meeting in time. We thus hung a paper scroll and let it run in-between us, immediately trying to write on it in a strictly simultaneous way. The fragile layer of paper as a white veil conveys light, warmth, and the other's breath. Only the heavy black ink of the other, neat as mine on the soft surface, is allowed to pass through, only the brushes hair, to touch. The pen follows its own mechanism, until the other's stroke appears : attraction, unexpected reaction, sudden distance, an infinite scale of variation and possible combinations is left half-opened to us. The result of this relation on paper is essentially out of control. Directing our attention on the meeting brushes, rather than on the appearing strokes, lead us to a more fluent rythm, out of preconceived patterns. Further discoveries and accidents await along the coming experiments. 
What does Biface Graphy brings to Calligraphy SHUFA ? The prevalent process brings calligraphy art to and end, or a new beginning [...].
Biface SHUFA is not re-designing ideograms, it is not looking for an
abstract rendering of calligraphy's beauty. It escapes from linguistic fixed structures but still expresses a relation between two distinct ensembles. It also can, with pleasure, take a distance from heroic creators of limited expressive tools. Selfish empires of meaning sprout everyday among the growing crowd of want-to-be Him, whose initiatives contribute to elaborate new dispositives of control and loneliness".

    ns2:title "Immortal at the River (临江仙)" ;
    ns3:description """The poem “Immortal at the River” (Lin jiang xian 临江仙) was composed by the Song poet Teng Zijing 滕子京 (990-1047).
In this poem, Teng Zijing describes the delightful landscape surrounding the Dongting Lake (prov. Hunan) during a misty autumn morning, evoking a melancholy atmosphere.
Teng Zijing, commonly known by his courtesy name as Teng Zongliang 滕宗谅, was an official and a fellow of the great reformer Fan Zhongyan 范仲淹 (989-1052), who was the Chancellor of the Song Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Renzong (1010-1063). Teng Zijing was famous because in 1045, when he served as local prefect of Yuezhou 岳州 (present Yueyang 岳阳 – Hunan province), he restored the famed ancient Yueyang Tower, a city gate by the side of the Dongting Lake, enlarging its scale and engraving on it the complete anthology of the Tang (618-907) and Song Dynasty poems written in that place. To commemorate this event, Teng Zijing invited Fan Zhongyan to write a descriptive prose entitled Yueyang Lou Ji 岳阳楼记 (On Yueyang Tower), his most famous literature work (Murck 2000, 107). In this text, Fan Zhongyan depicted the breathtaking landscape surrounding the Yueyang Tower. Deeply affected by this beautiful scenery, also Teng Zijing decided to compose a poem entitled Lin jiang xian. In this poem, he firstly focused on the most charming part of the delightful landscape, the vast Dongting Lake (l. 1), which dazzled in the morning sun of an autumn day (l. 2). The well-known Junshan Hill with its peaks stood in the middle of the lake, and it is compared to the legendary island of Penglai 蓬莱, a mountain where the Taoist Immortals were said to live (l. 3). In the distance, a grey evening mist was emerging from the Yun and Meng Marshes (l. 4), and slowly faded the city of Yueyang (l. 5). The view of Junshan Hill recalls to poet’s mind the famous legend of the Xiang River Goddness (l. 6). Legend has it that 4,000 years ago when Emperor Shun toured in South China, his two concubines E Huang 娥皇 and Nü Ying 女英 (also called Xiang Fei 湘妃 and Xiang Jun 湘君) went to search for their husband. When they got to the Junshan Hill, they knew he was dead. They wept so long that the bamboos on which their tears dropped changed into mottled bamboos. Later they passed away and were buried on the hill, and to memorialise these two soulful lovers, the mountain was renamed Junshan 君山. In the second stanza of the poem, Teng Zijing commemorated this event evoking a melancholy tune played by the spirits of the Xiang River Goddesses (ll. 6-7). The song permeated the hearts of the listeners while a breeze was spreading the scent of the orchids (l. 8). But when the tune came to an end, people went away (l. 9), disappearing among the green mountains (l. 10). 
In this poem Teng Zijing quoted two other poems of the Tang period: i) the fourth and the fifth lines of his poem coincides with the third and the fourth lines of a poem by Meng Haoran’s 孟浩然 (689-740) entitled Gazing at Dongting Lake, Presented to Prime Minister Zhang’ (Wang Dongting hu zeng Zhang chengxiang 望洞庭湖赠张丞相); while ii) his last two lines correspond to the last two lines of a poem by Qian Qi’s 钱起 (ca. 722-785) entitled Musical soul of the Xiang River (Xiang ling guse 湘灵鼓瑟).

    ns3:description """This Calli-Writing Unit is the second inscription, on the upper left-hand corner. It is a long calligraphy composed of 45 columns of Chinese characters written in a highly stenographic cursive style (caoshu 草书), in which the strokes of the characters are merged sometimes, impairing their recognizability. It is written in vertical columns to be read from right to left and from top to bottom, as is customary in classical Chinese, and is embellished by a pronounced dripping effect, which seems to simulate ink drippings on paper.  The calligraphic style (caoshu), the variation of the width of the strokes, the arrangement of the text in vertical columns (from top to bottom), and the reading direction (from right to left) follow the traditional calligraphic manner and recalls the strict rules of Chinese traditional calligraphy, but a widespread ‘dripping’ effect underlines the graffiti taste.
The content of the calligraphy is inspired by a Song poem entitled "Immortal at the River" (Lin jiang xian 临江仙) composed by Teng Zijing 滕子京 (990-1047). In this poem, Teng Zijing describes the delightful landscape surrounding the Dongting Lake (prov. Hunan) during a misty autumn morning, evoking a melancholy atmosphere.
According to Chinese classical aesthetic principles, in Shanshui PIC the use of Teng Zijing’s poetry (shi 诗) written in calligraphic style (shu 书) to enhance the depiction of a landscape painting (hua 画) suggests the reference to the so-called “three perfections” (sanjue 三绝), the Chinese indissoluble artistic triad of “poetry, calligraphy, and painting” (shi shu hua 诗书画) that represents one of the basis of Chinese traditional culture. From the eighth century onward, in China these three art forms have been known as the ‘three perfections’ (san jue 三绝), and they have been intimately connected in the minds of the ‘Chinese literati’ (wen ren 文人), representing the basis of traditional Chinese culture (Sullivan 1974, 7). The strict link among these three art forms is composed of three different aspects: the relationship between poetry and painting, calligraphy and poetry, and calligraphy and painting. In Shanshui PIC, this binomial between poetry and painting was realised by two elements: the first one is Teng Zijing’s poem, which is a vivid representation of scenery and fuses scene and mood; the second one is the landscape painting that can be described as being ‘poem-like’ (shi yi ban de 诗一般的). The strict relationship between calligraphic technique and literally content has been restated by the use of ‘cursive script’ (caoshu). Cursive script is faster to write than other styles, so in Shanshui PIC (and in particular in the long calligraphy written by EricTin) it embodies the fleeting nature of the joy of the encounter described in Teng Zijing’s poem and it is an echo of the brief meeting between the graffiti work and the people walking down the street experimented by the writers themselves while shaping their piece. Finally, the binomial between calligraphy and painting is realized by the use of the same artistic instrument: traditionally it was the brush, here is the spray can that is employed to shape both calligraphy and painting producing similar effects. In Chinese traditional art, in fact, “the brush, the instrument of the calligrapher, is also used by the painter, and the results produced by the use of dots and strokes are similar” (Qi 1991, 13). Similarly, in this work, the spray can, the instrument of the graffiti writer, is used for shaping both calligraphy and painting and the result produced by dripping and outlines techniques is equal. So, we can affirm that, in this graffiti piece as well as in any traditional painting, ‘calligraphy and painting have the same source’ (shu hua tong yuan 书画同源). Crossing these three binomials, Shanshui PIC is a worthy example of the perfect triangulation of the “three perfections” in a contemporary graffiti artwork.
The choice of get inspiration from the poem "Immortal at the River" (Lin jiang xian 临江仙) and his poet Teng Zijing 滕子京is extremely significant. Teng Zijing, commonly known by his courtesy name as Teng Zongliang 滕宗谅, was an official and a fellow of the great reformer Fan Zhongyan 范仲淹 (989-1052), who was the Chancellor of the Song Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Renzong (1010-1063). Teng Zijing was famous because in 1045, when he served as local prefect of Yuezhou 岳州 (present Yueyang 岳阳 – Hunan province), he restored the famed ancient Yueyang Tower, a city gate by the side of the Dongting Lake, enlarging its scale and engraving on it the complete anthology of the Tang (618-907) and Song Dynasty poems written in that place. To commemorate this event, Teng Zijing invited Fan Zhongyan to write a descriptive prose entitled Yueyang Lou Ji 岳阳楼记 (On Yueyang Tower), his most famous literature work (Murck 2000, 107). In this text, Fan Zhongyan depicted the breathtaking landscape surrounding the Yueyang Tower. Deeply affected by this beautiful scenery, also Teng Zijing decided to compose a poem entitled Lin jiang xian. In this poem, he firstly focused on the most charming part of the delightful landscape, the vast Dongting Lake (l. 1), which dazzled in the morning sun of an autumn day (l. 2). The well-known Junshan Hill with its peaks stood in the middle of the lake, and it is compared to the legendary island of Penglai 蓬莱, a mountain where the Taoist Immortals were said to live (l. 3). In the distance, a grey evening mist was emerging from the Yun and Meng Marshes (l. 4), and slowly faded the city of Yueyang (l. 5). The view of Junshan Hill recalls to poet’s mind the famous legend of the Xiang River Goddness (l. 6). Legend has it that 4,000 years ago when Emperor Shun toured in South China, his two concubines E Huang 娥皇 and Nü Ying 女英 (also called Xiang Fei 湘妃 and Xiang Jun 湘君) went to search for their husband. When they got to the Junshan Hill, they knew he was dead. They wept so long that the bamboos on which their tears dropped changed into mottled bamboos. Later they passed away and were buried on the hill, and to memorialise these two soulful lovers, the mountain was renamed Junshan 君山. In the second stanza of the poem, Teng Zijing commemorated this event evoking a melancholy tune played by the spirits of the Xiang River Goddesses (ll. 6-7). The song permeated the hearts of the listeners while a breeze was spreading the scent of the orchids (l. 8). But when the tune came to an end, people went away (l. 9), disappearing among the green mountains (l. 10). 
In this poem Teng Zijing quoted two other poems of the Tang period: i) the fourth and the fifth lines of his poem coincides with the third and the fourth lines of a poem by Meng Haoran’s 孟浩然 (689-740) entitled Gazing at Dongting Lake, Presented to Prime Minister Zhang’ (Wang Dongting hu zeng Zhang chengxiang 望洞庭湖赠张丞相); while ii) his last two lines correspond to the last two lines of a poem by Qian Qi’s 钱起 (ca. 722-785) entitled Musical soul of the Xiang River (Xiang ling guse 湘灵鼓瑟).
In Shanshui PIC, the choice of writing the Teng Zijing’s poem “Lin jiang xian” is also a way to reactivate a chain of literary quotations, as it had already happened for the choice of depicting landscape sceneries inspired by Fan Kuan, Wang Ximeng and Qian Xuan’s paintings. The use of quotations is very common in Chinese classical poetry. In this specific case, the transcription of Teng Zijing’s poem activates the quotations’ mechanism in six different ways. In fact, i) in Lin jiang xian, other poems have been quoted (Meng Haoran’s and Qian Qi’s poems); ii) Teng Zijing mentions a famous scenic spot, the Junshan Hill, that since ancient times has been filled with legends, including the most popular of the Xiang River Goddesses recalled in the second stanza; iii) the poem takes inspiration from a place (the Yueyang Tower) that since Tang Dynasty had become a popular place for literati to compose their poems; iv) most of these ancient poems were engraved by Teng Zijing himself on the Yueyang Tower in 1045; v) the Yueyang Tower named in the poem also inspired the descriptive prose entitled Youyang lou ji written by Fan Zhongyan and commissioned by Teng Zejing; iv) the title of the poem is the same as other famous Song poems; all these poems express similar emotions and recall Teng Zijing’s poem, even if with different words. The Kwanyin Clan want to write a poem able to communicate the feelings of loneliness and sadness following a joyful reunion and at the same time able to evoke the landscape scenery painted in the background of their artwork. Teng Zijing’s poem best achieves both these goals, even if the themes of loneliness, melancholy, and nature description are in common with all the listed poems. Because of this similarity, here the quotations’ mechanism is particularly suitable for the crew’s intentions because it refers to hypertexts that share the basic themes of the source text, but amplifying their possible meanings. According to EricTin, in fact, the main function of Teng Zijing’s poem is to describe the content of their artwork and at the same time to express not only the sense of happiness experienced in the encounter with a graffiti work, but also the feelings of loneliness and sadness following this encounter. EricTin explains that this encounter usually ‘lasts very briefly’ (tan hua yi xian 昙花一现) because of the ephemeral and localised status of any graffiti piece. Very few people can see their originals and, at the end, only some photos stored in a computer remain as their records. So the joy of the meeting is replaced with the pain of the parting and the melancholy of the oblivion, as all the ‘quoted’ poems have already testified."""@en ;

In this performance, Zhang Qiang writes on sheets of paper and on geometric shapes made of white chalk. The artist is seen from behind and never looks at where he paints, while the female British counterpart named Sophia Huist conveys the artist's movements. She moves the paper or objects on which Zhang Qiang is working, thus shattering, or deconstructing his work. The paper sheets and the plaster's geometric shapes are full of black ink traces (lines and spots). After being used for the performance, these geometric shapes will be also used for an installation." ;

    ns3:description """The Calli-Writing Unit in the central part of the artwork is composed of the four characters of the title (shi ru po zhu 势如破竹) written in a very hard wildstyle. 
The "charactering painting" is both a calligraphy in "big characters" (dazi 大字) and a graffiti painting.
They form a Chinese "four-character idiom" (chengyu 成语) and are surrounded by other two wildstyle pieces: the first one, on the upper left, is probably by EricTin, because of the leitmotiv of the sphere with the traditional character "Guan 觀" in the centre, and of the thin pinnacles sprouting from the intricate characters; the second one, on the lower right, is by Yumi (the small tag written in red confirms his authorship) and its undecipherable forms suggest a big fire whose flames burn and generate the whole artwork. The central piece is by Nat, because the letters of his name (NaTuo) are intermingled and blended into the strokes of the Chinese characters. In addition to the diagonal stripe composed of these three pieces, there are two other important elements in this work: the long black calligraphy in the top right corner, and the red colophon in the bottom left corner.
The insertion of the chengyu "shi ru po zhu 势如破竹" in the central piece of the work has a specific purpose. As EricTin explains: "I like using four-characters chengyu as the basis of my works, because there is always a story behind them that exceeds the literal meaning of the four characters". The literal meaning of shirupozhu is "having a power (shi) to (ru) cut down (po) a bamboo (zhu)". It originally refers to the act of smashing into enemy territory "like splitting a bamboo". This idiom refers to the traditional way of splitting bamboo by cutting a slit on the top of it in such a way that it splits in two halves. The idiom describes incisive and "overwhelming power". This reference to an "overwhelming power" is probably an indirect quote of the motto of the crew "push forward with an overwhelming momentum" recorded in their logo. This expression comes from the Book of Jin (Jinshu 晋书): it is quoted in the fourth chapter of the third section about Biographies (lie zhuan 列传) of the Book, that is the 34th volume (juan 卷) of the whole text. The second half of this chapter focuses on Du Yu 杜预 (222-285), a military general of the Wei state (220-265) in the late Three Kingdoms period (220-280) and early Jin Dynasty (265-420). In 265, the ruler of the Wei state abdicated in favour of the Prince Sima Yan 司马炎 (236-290), who ended the Wei state and became the first emperor of the Jin Dynasty. Du Yu became one of his most powerful general and he led an army in the conquest of the Wu state (222-280), their bitter rival. In 280, before the last and crucial attack against the Wu army, Du Yu pronounced the four characters of the chengyu (shi ru po zhu) to incite the troops, reminding them that until that moment they had smashed into enemy territory without difficulty "like splitting bamboo", so they must not be afraid to join the battle. His speech produced the desired effect: his army won the battle, the Wu state was conquered and the Chinese territory was reunified. Using this chengyu, the Kwanyin Clan wants to connect Du Yu’s story with the main theme of the artistic project that inspired its graffiti work.
"Shirupozhu" was shaped from 4th to 6th February 2008 at the Nike 706 Art Space in the 798 Art District. This art space was established in January 2007 in the subfactory 706 by Nike China, so it was called "Nike 706". The main aim of this cultural experience centre is to promote Nike brand and to ignite Chinese athletes, leveraging the power of creativity, sport, and self-expression. In 2008, the Kwanyin Clan joined a project entitled Lebron Experience Center, one of the two projects sponsored by Nike China to explain and promote the game of basketball to the Chinese public through a series of pieces showing the history and the future of the game, which is personified by Michael Jordan and Lebron James. The first event connected to the Lebron Experience Centre was entitled Lebron Six Experiences. For its launch, "the art space was transformed into an adaptable space that combined a digitally augmented Lebron coaching exhibit and professional basketball game court in one". Lebron teaches about the six aspects of this game that help him become a very good player: DUNK, STEAL, POST UP, PASS, FADE AWAY, and DRIVE. Spaceships like mechanical cylinders were hung from the ceiling according to the zones and could be elevated or relegated to transform the space into a basketball court or training exhibit. Lowering the cylinders would activate Lebron’s 3D hologram giving a face to face coaching experience to each basketball fan. For the opening ceremony of that event (the night of 6th February), on the external wall of the art space, a huge hall-of-fame was mounted to host six graffiti pieces. Each piece was shaped by a famous Chinese crew. The invited crews were: the Xianggang Fengwei 湘港风味, the FLB CREW, the Kwanyin Clan, the ABS CREW, the BJPZ CREW, and the NGC CREW. The six Lebron’s signature moves (DUNK, STEAL, POST UP, PASS, FADE AWAY, and DRIVE) respectively became the main subjects of their graffiti pieces. The subject of the Kwanyin Clan piece was the "post-up" (tupo 突破). In Chinese, "tupo" literally means "make a breakthrough, break through a defence" so the Kwanyin Clan chose the expression Shiripozhu (With Irresistible Force) as the fil rouge of its work, linking Lebron’s and Du Yu’s stories. However, the connection activated by the Kwanyin Clan concerns not only the meaning of the basket position and the story of this chengyu but also the meaning of the chengyu and the title of the inaugural party of the "Lebron Six Experiences" event. This inaugural party was called Quanliyifu. Quanliyifu is another chengyu which means "go all out, spare no effort". For the Lebron’s party it was translated into English with the phrase "Bring Everything" that can be easily linked to the concept of "with irresistible force" conveyed in the title of the Kwanyin Clan’s work."""@en ;

    ns3:description "The poem entitled \"Full River Red\" (Man jiang hong 满 江红) was composed by Yue Fei 岳飞 (1103-1142), an officer of the Northern Song army. In 1127, when the Northern Song Dynasty came to an end as the Jurchen-Jin conquered northern China and the Song retreated south in the face of their attacks, he opposed the retreat. He continued, however, to serve the emperor of the Southern Song (1127-1279), engaging continuous battles with the Jurchen. He experienced success in his campaign against the Jin in 1140, but the Southern Song Gaozong Emperor (1107-1187) sought to make peace with the Jin, and ordered Yue Fei to withdraw, dashing in one moment all his achievements of ten years. Yue Fei composed this poem  during one of his victorious campaign against the Jin. In this poem, he describes his strong efforts to recover the lost territory, to fight against the barbarians and to persuade the emperor to support his army."@en ;

Shao Yan engraved the four characters on the surface of the vessel and then filled in the blue color. The four characters recall the "bird seal script" (niao zhuan 鸟篆), a kind of artistic script in common use during the late Warring States period (475-221 BC). This script is characterized by gently and intricated curved lines decorated with bird designs. In this work, Shao Yan re-elaborates this script drawing birds and fishes in a naïf style, recalling the acquatic scene evoked by the four characters.

    ns2:title "Shao Yan Blue and White  Porcelain - Bird Seal Script Series (邵岩蓝百瓷器 - 鸟篆系列)" ;
    ns3:description """This series was executed in 2015 by Shao Yan and was exhibited the same year (May 15 – June 7) at the "Calligraphy and Ceramics Art Exhibition" (Shufa taoci yishu zhan 书法陶瓷艺术展) opened in Suzhou at the Ming Art Museum (Ming meishuguan 明·美术馆). The exhibition, called “Between Squares and Circles” (fangyuan zhejian 方圆之间), featured 60 pieces of calligraphy works carried out by three outstanding young and middle-aged calligraphers in contemporary China: Shao Yan, Li Qiang 李强 and Xu Guixun 徐圭逊. 
The works present forms and styles similar to circles and squares. Shao Yan engraved characters on the surface of the vessel and then filled in the blue color. The characters recall the "bird seal script" (niao zhuan 鸟篆), a kind of artistic script in common use during the late Warring States period (475-221 BC). This script is characterized by gently and intricated curved lines decorated with bird designs. In these works, Shao Yan re-elaborates this script in a naïf style.
In this exhibition, six vases of this series are displayed: three "maotong"(帽筒) vases in ceramics entitled “Spring and Autumn” (春华秋实) and “Good as Water” (Shangshanruoshui 上善若水); two little quivers of arrows called “To do Good without Fame or Fortune” (Qi yinguo bao fang xingshan, bu wei mingli yi dushu 豈因果报方行善，不为名利亦读书); a jade pot spring vase called “Namo Amithaba Buddha” (Namo Emituofo 南无阿弥陀佛) and a water-washed porcelain bowl called “Harmony in the Family” (Jia he wanshi xing 家和万事兴)."""@en ;

    ns3:description """This Calli-Writing Unit is the long calligraphy on the upper right side of the artwork and it is another reference to the concept of arduous and tenacious struggle. 
The calligraphy was written in vertical columns from right to left, following the traditional manner.  The long calligraphy is written in running script (xingshu 行书), that is characterised by a very ‘tangled’ and tense style, that reproduces the tumultuous battles evoked in the poem and the burning passion expressed in its lines. 
The content of this calligraphy is a poem entitled "Full River Red" (Man jiang hong 满 江红) composed by Yue Fei 岳飞 (1103-1142), an officer of the Northern Song army. In 1127, when the Northern Song Dynasty came to an end as the Jurchen-Jin conquered northern China and the Song retreated south in the face of their attacks, he opposed the retreat. He continued, however, to serve the emperor of the Southern Song (1127-1279), engaging continuous battles with the Jurchen. He experienced success in his campaign against the Jin in 1140, but the Southern Song Gaozong Emperor (1107-1187) sought to make peace with the Jin, and ordered Yue Fei to withdraw, dashing in one moment all his achievements of ten years. Yue Fei composed a poem entitled Ma jiang hong during one of his victorious campaign against the Jin. In this poem, he describes his strong efforts to recover the lost territory, to fight against the barbarians and to persuade the emperor to support his army.
The junction between Yue Fei’s brave behavior described in the poem and the "post-up" movement recorded in the graffiti work depends on the four-characters of the chengyu depicted in the centre. In fact, the attitude of a basketball player in a post-up position and of a general while contrasting his enemies is equally characterized by "irresistible force". To post-up the player has to shield his defender behind him with his body so that he can receive the pass with ease; similarly, Yue Fei wants to shield the territories he had reconquered with his army and continue his advance so that he can give them back to the emperor."""@en ;

In this inscription, Chinese characters and Latin letters are juxtaposed, like in other Kwanyin Clan’s works: the two characters GuanYin 观音 [觀音] are written vertically in cursive-running style (xingcaoshu 行草书), in the form of a traditional colophon with the signature of the artist (Kwanyin) near the main calligraphy (the four characters shirupozhu); while the four tags of the members of the crew, who were the authors of the artwork (ERICTIN, NAT, YUMI, QUANER), are written horizontally from left to right, as it is in every graffiti piece. Even if in these two lines (vertical and horizontal) the writing systems are different (Chinese characters vs Latin letters), the writing style (of both characters and letters) is identical, so that the two inscriptions seem to be the same thing, merging Chinese and Western traditions into one. This graffiti inscription recalls the use of red seals in traditional Chinese art for three reasons: the red color, the position and the content (signature of the artists). "@en ;

Some of these installations have also been created outside Cina, such as in Paris in 2007 or in front of the Pyramids of Giza in 2008. One of Zhang Qiang's latest installations took place in London in 2018, where he collaborated with the artist Zhang Kaini 张凯尼.

Qiu Zhijie collected and classified many different forms of writing, both public and personal. For each form of scripture, he carved a layer of concrete. After the plate is dry the inscriptions were printed on paper by rubbing with ink, and a new layer of concrete was poured, upon which a new set of characters was then inscribed.

It consists of about a dozen blue and white ceramic objects, with different shapes and sizes. At the time of decoration, a gray colored glaze (you liao 釉料), a material particularly used for Chinese ceramic painting, is diluted in water and then applied on ceramics. After entering the kiln and firing it, the color of the ceramic object turns into blue. For some glazes, it happens that there is no color difference before and after firing. In this case, the graze used has turned into a blue colour.
On the pottery there is also a "red sign" representing the two charaters of the female counterpart's name "青枝" (Qingzhi). """@en ;

The full text of the inscription is "Zhongyue xiansheng ying yang zheng daozhao you pan zhii shangu ye ci bai ju gu 中岳先生荧阳郑道昭游槃之山谷也此白驹谷" ("The valley where Mr. Zhongyue Yingyang Zheng Daozhao visited Pan is also Baiju Valley") and "This Baiju Valley" has a total of 19 characters. The entire inscription is one foot square in diameter. It is a precious treasure of calligraphy art in Weifang.
The technique of rubbing consists in applying a sheet of paper with longer and more resisting fibers to the rocky surface of a cliff, stele or even small seal stone, to then ink the sheet, and take a life-size copy of the rubbed surface. An inversion in the perception of relief and shade takes place when intaglio lines become white, and relief parts, black. Obviously, while deep intaglio is totally white and high relief, black, there is a whole realm of in-betweenness where the middle grounds, low relief and smooth concavities can only be expressed in shades of grey. Rubbing is thus extremely interpretative and is a form of indirect perception, comparable to photography."""@en ;

    ns3:trascription-or-translation """It is the ninth year of Emperor Mu of Jin's Yonghe era
The year of the Yin Water Ox,
At the beginning of the third lunar month,
We are all gathered at the orchid pavilion in Shanyin County, Guiji Commandery,
For the Spring Purification Festival.
All of the prominent people have arrived,
From old to young.
This is an area of high mountains and lofty peaks,
With an exuberant growth of trees and bamboos,
It also has clear rushing water,
Reflecting the sunlight as it flows past either side of the pavilion.
The guests are seated side by side to play the drinking game where a wine cup is floated down the stream and the first person sitting in front of the cup when it stops must drink.
Although we lack the boisterousness of a live orchestra,
With a cup of wine here and a reciting of poetry there, it is sufficient to allow for a pleasant exchange of cordial conversations.
Today, the sky is bright and the air is clear,
With a gentle breeze that is blowing freely. When looking up, one can see the vastness of the heavens,
And when looking down, one can observe the abundance of things. The contentment of allowing one’s eyes to wander,
Is enough to reach the heights of delight for the sight and sound. What a joy.
Now all people live in this world together,
Some will take all of their aspirations, and share them in private with a friend;
Still others will abandon themselves to reckless pursuits.
Even though everyone makes different choices in life, some thoughtful and some rash,
When a person meets with joy, he will temporarily be pleased,
And will feel content, but he is not mindful that old age will soon overtake him.
Wait until that person becomes weary, or has a change of heart about something,
And will thus be filled with regrets.
The happiness of the past, in the blink of an eye,
Will have already become a distant memory, and this cannot but cause one to sigh;
In any case, the length of a man’s life is determined by the Creator, and we will all turn to dust in the end.
The ancients have said, "Birth and Death are both momentous occasions."
Isn’t that sad!
Every time I consider the reasons for why the people of old had regrets,
I am always moved to sadness by their writings,
And I can not explain why I am saddened.
I most certainly know that it is false and absurd to treat life and death as one and the same,
And it is equally absurd to think of dying at an old age as being the same as dying at a young age.
When future generations look back to my time, it will probably be similar to how I now think of the past.
What a shame! Therefore, when I list out the people that were here,
And record their musings, even though times and circumstances will change,
As for the things that we regret, they are the same.
For the people who read this in future generations, perhaps you will likewise be moved by these words."""@en,

It consists of the characters written by Wu Xixia inside an inflatable hermetic sphere during the performance \"I\" (Wo 我) that took place in 2020. In this performance, Wu Xixia carries out a reflection on women and herself, writing the labels of society’s goodwill and malice towards women in red paint, such as \"whore\" (biao zi 婊子) \"old maid\" (lao chunu 老处女), \"good wife and loving mother\" (xian qiliang mu 贤妻良母), \"green tea bitch (luchabiao 绿茶婊), \"teenage girl\" (yunu 玉女), \"white lotus\" (bailian hua 白莲花) etc. She answers questions such as: \"Who are women? And who am I? Is my gender determined by birth or is it given by society? There is a womb here, but where is the \"mother\"?\" Having been rejected by her family at the time of her birth as a female, she has been questioning her gender throughout her formative years, and the social labels she writes about are an attempt to reconcile herself with her gender identity."@en ;

    ns2:title "Artwork of Confrontation  (对峙)" ;
    ns3:description """This artwork is the result of the performance "Confrontation". It consists of the mannequin a red humanoid mannequin used by the artist Wu Xixia during the performance. The artist writes with a brush the white characters "human" (ren 人) and "art" (yishu 艺术) on the mannequin to give life to the inanimate object, announcing the beginning of the confrontation. To the sound of the drums, the artist "stabs" the mannequin with the brush, leaving traces of white and red ink on the object. Each time Wu Xixia hits the mannequin, laser beams are projected onto the artist's back, until both the mannequin and the artist's body are covered with marks. At that point, the cloth is replaced and the "fall" of both sides marks the end of the confrontation.
The humanoid mannequin is an inanimate object created by industrial civilization and modern technology, while the living person represents humanity, identity, role, creation, etc. The dynamics of the act of "punching each other" through this game of parts represents the confrontation between living and non-living beings. Both sides are kneeling towards each other, in an equal position, just to represent that at the end there is no winner.
As Wu Xixia helself explained: "The mannequin in "Confrontation" is made of plastic-plated stainless steel. I sawed off the legs of the ready-made vertical mannequin and turned it into a kneeling state. In fact, at first I thought about using a female body as a mannequin, but I think AI is a genderless non-creature, and I don't want to use looks to blur the concept. For me, the act of comparison is a kind of game. From the microscopic to the macroscopic point of view, the mannequin is a dead object, an inanimate body created by industrial civilization and modern technology, and the living person represents human beings, identities, roles, creations, etc. it is God. The behavior dynamic of "poking" with the tip of the pen represents the confrontation between the living body and the non-living body, and the "kneeling" pattern of both sides represents that there is no winner. Is the coexistence of dead and living things that give meaning to "human beings" controlled or lost in the development of science and technology? Is this exploration of materiality and non-materiality a superego or a complete me? The art itself explores the meaning of existence and the meaning of creation. At the end of the confrontation, 'I' poked 'it' with God's fingertips [...] I wrote the word 'person' on the body of the 'mannequin' on the front, and the word 'art' on the back , which is the product of the transfer from the imaginary world to the real world, even if it is always resisting expression and giving meaning. The appearance of the word "person" in the "mannequin" made of mirrored material is a sign of self-certification and self-affirmation. This is also my thought on the combination of Lacan's "symbolic world-imaginary world-real world" and the theory of the mirror [...]. Expression is also accompanied by "comparison" behavior. On the one hand I understand that art can be both refined and popular, and on the other hand I also understand that art needs unique expression, and this state often has binary oppositions. The backlash and tension between these dualities also drives us to become more well-rounded people"."""@en ;

Wei Ligang embeds his work in this lineage with this large scroll where he let his spontaneous but well-learned gestures flow on five vertical sequences of characters deconstructed into pure lyrical rhythm and juxtaposed through subtle tonal nuances, carefully mastered through the dilution of the ink and the sensibility of the movement. If the piece clearly evocates the spontaneity of the wild-grass style, nevertheless it also shows a deliberate accuracy and attention to showing a broad variety of strokes, an alternation of clean bold marks and more overlapping delicate ones, together with an eloquent mastery of tone.

    ns3:description "This CWU is part of the work \"Ten Thousand Birds Startled by the Dawn Drums (Wan dian cheng niao jing shu gu de shuxie danwei 万点城鸟惊曙鼓)\" executed by Wei Ligang in 2011. In this work Wei Ligang, at least in part, moves away from any calligraphic register recognizable at first sight, to explore a different kind of composition which looks as if it was informed both by the modernist geometrical abstraction and also by some other figurative imagery and primitive decorative motives. In reality, this operation is part of nearly thirty years of artistic exploration, during which Wei Ligang has been creating a universal abstract language based on the lines and spatial structures of Chinese characters. This language attempts to accommodate the complexity of a variety of western and eastern elements. In his so-called \"Wei's Magic Block\" he deconstructs Chinese characters and incorporates image elements, tracing back to the origin of pictographs. The choice of the large round canvas and the mixed media technique (ink and acrylic) establishes another parallel between the eastern tradition (in which the round support is a classic choice but mainly on paper and silk) and the work of several western lyrical and geometrical abstract artists. The choice of another eastern classical element, the palette, black on golden-brown, together with the homogeneous thickness of the line contribute to highlight the hybridity of this work, which is then further re-elaborate with reversed colors on xuan paper mounted in the form of a large screen (as in the work \"Fluttering Butterflies and Buzzing Bees, a Pleasure Boat and Orchids at Dawn\", Die luan feng xuan lan xiao hua ge 蝶乱蜂喧 兰晓画舸, 2016). We could also find a visual reference for the shapes and the character of the Nazca Lines, a collection of giant geoglyphs—designs or motifs etched into the ground—located in the Peruvian coastal plain about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Lima, Peru. There are three basic types of Nazca Lines: straight lines, geometric designs and pictorial representations. The Nazca are large environmental artworks only visible from the sky, despite the obvious differences in terms of context, size and technicality."@en ;

    ns2:title "The Music of Ink - Calligraphies by Luo Qi and Silvio Ferragina in dialogue with the Chinese archive collection of the Braidense Library" ;
    ns3:description """The exhibition "The Music of Ink at the Braidense National Library" is a journey to discover the ancient and fascinating art of Chinese calligraphy and its intimate connection with music. The protagonists of this unique experience are two eminent contemporary calligraphers, the Chinese master Luo Qi and the Italian master Silvio Ferragina. Chinese Calligraphy is usually defined “silent but having musical harmony”. Inspired by this musical harmony, these two artists have transformed their calligraphies into astonishing ink scores by means of their rhythmic traces of brush. In this exhibition, Luo Qi and Silvio Ferragina present new series of calligraphic artworks in the form of long panels that cover the whole gallery of Sala Maria Teresa with an enveloping and captivating melody of signs. 
Luo Qi (Hangzhou, 1960) is an internationally renowned artist and the leading figure of the most important Chinese post-modern calligraphy movement. For the exhibition, he created a series entitled "The music of Ink – Silent Melodies". In this series, he translated some of the most famous Italian songs (e.g. “O sole mio” and “Volare”) and arias of operas (e.g. “Rigoletto” and “La traviata”) into concatenations of calligraphic signs inspired by the oldest Chinese musical notation system. This system dates back to the seventh century and consists of some of the most ancient Chinese characters.  
Silvio Ferragina (Milan 1962) is an Italian calligrapher and is actively involved in the calligraphic modernization movement. In his series entitled "Ink – CHING: Musicalligraphy Divinations", he took inspiration from the I-Ching, an ancient Chinese divination text and the oldest of the Chinese Classics. He translated eight of its hexagrams into musical notes in pentagrams. A hexagram is a figure composed of six stacked horizontal lines (continuous or broken) obtained by throwing coins. Using a sophisticated mathematical system designed by himself, he transformed the strokes of the characters of each hexagram into musical notations. Thus, he passed from hexagrams to characters and, finally, to real music. In their “calligraphic ink symphonies”, Luo Qi and Silvio Ferragina embody the harmonious encounter between East and West, dialoguing in a prestigious space, the National Braidense Library, that is "resonant with worldwide culture". A precious selection of documents and books from the Chinese archive collection of the Library will be exhibit together with the calligraphy series. In the showcases, will be shown some important works that testify the interest for China starting with the Gesuits. Among them, there is a rare example of the Planisphere developed by the Jesuit Giulio Aleni (1582-1649), who received the name “Confucius from the West”. This map was commissioned by the Emperor Wan Li and published in 1623, and it is one of the first maps of the Chinese Empire. Another important document stored in the Library is the imperial diploma of the Jesuit astronomer Johann Adam Schall von Bell (1591-1666) awarded by the Imperial court for the publication of his new calendar in 1630. Next to these two important documents, will be also exhibited seventeenth-century grammars and manuals for teaching Chinese language to missionaries. In addition to the Chinese manuscripts, will be shown important works written by Giuseppe Hager (1757-1819), an Italian-German theologian and scholar of oriental languages who was appointed as librarian in the Braidense in 1806. These texts prove his strong interest in the Far East. Among them, the most precious are: "Memory on the Eastern Compass" (1809-1810), "Memory on the Arabic figures attributed to the Indians, but invented in a country [China] that is more remote than India" (1813) and "Chinese Inscriptions in Quàng-ceu, the city commonly called ‘Canton’ by the Europeans "(1816). The more recent collection of Edoarda Masi will juxtapose with these ancient archives. This collection was donated to Braidense Library in 2012 and it has never been shown to the public until today. Edoarda Masi (1927-2011) was one of the most important Italian sinologists of the XX century: she was Professor of Chinese Modern and Contemporary Literature at the University of Naples “L’Orientale” and Professor of Italian Language at the University of Foreign Languages in Shanghai; she worked as a librarian in the National Libraries of Florence, Rome and Milan; she wrote several books on China and translated lots of Chinese literary books. Many significant texts from her collection have been selected for the exhibition, like for example the “Dream of the Red Chamber” (Honglou meng), one of China's Four Great Classical Novels that she translated in 1964, a copy of Mao's Little Red Book autographed by Lin Biao (1907-1971), essays, dictionaries and other important materials for her study and research. Some rare documents of the Ricordi Historical Archive housed in the Braidense Library are also part of the exhibition. From this noteworthy private music collection, a precious selection of documents relating to “Turandot” by Giacomo Puccini is displayed because of its setting in China. Among them, the visitors have admired Puccini’s autograph score, the original figurines designed by Umberto Brunelleschi as requested by Puccini, a copy of the limited edition printed score of the opera with a cover hand-painted by Leopoldo Metlicovitz, and the Turandot libretto and magazine published for the world premiere on 25 April 1926. All these documents prove the great work of research and reinterpretation of Chinese culture merged into the opera of the Tuscan Master. The exhibition is curated by Adriana Iezzi, and it owes its origin to an idea of Silvio Ferragina. The selection of the Chinese documents and books is curated by Aldo Coletto e Marina Zetti of the Braidense Library. The production is by Tadaam in collaboration with the Braidense Library. The exhibition opened at the Sala Maria Teresa of the Braidense Library on March 21, 2018 at 18.30. Luo Qi and Silvio Ferragina took part in the opening ceremony and, in that occasion, they created together a “musicalligraphy performance”. An animated work on paper by the young artist Guido Ballatori (Ascoli Piceno, 1983) was also part of the exhibition. The exhibition was also enriched by an exciting calendar of exhibition-inspired events and collateral activities. In particular, every week famous international artists and musicians will join in musicalligraphy performances inspired by different Chinese calligraphic styles and musical genres. Among them, the most important are Sainkho Namtchylak, a voice full of light, space and time with tonal characteristics that make it unique; Aisha, alias Andrea Dulbecco and Luca Gusella, who are two virtuosos of vibraphone and five-octave marimba and also well-rounded percussionists; Ares Tavolazzi and Alessandro Cerrino, a formidable and unmissable contemporary Jazz duo; and Giulio Casale and Michele Rabbia, voice and music in which you can find a safe house. The organization of these events is by Tadaam. 
The exhibition continued through April 28 at the Sala Maria Teresa of the National Braidense Library. During the finissage the famous London-based Chinese artist Chloe NiLi (Shanghai, 1989) created an extraordinary performance of calligraphy and body painting. """@en ;

Since the new slogan had changed from Hu Jingtao’s ‘Harmonious society’ to Xi Jingping’s ‘Chinese Dream’, this action was thought to send a provocative message about the contradiction between the continuity of the unresolved precarity between the government change. The choice of red is obviously linked to the Chinese tradition of writing with red ink (and even blood) to convey and something urgent and aggressive.

The guests are seated side by side to play the drinking game where a wine cup is floated down the stream and the first person sitting in front of the cup when it stops must drink.
Although we lack the boisterousness of a live orchestra,
With a cup of wine here and a reciting of poetry there, it is sufficient to allow for a pleasant exchange of cordial conversations.
Today, the sky is bright and the air is clear,
With a gentle breeze that is blowing freely. When looking up, one can see the vastness of the heavens,
And when looking down, one can observe the abundance of things. The contentment of allowing one’s eyes to wander,
Is enough to reach the heights of delight for the sight and sound. What a joy."""@en,

It was compiled in 648 by a number of officials commissioned by the imperial court of the Tang dynasty, with chancellor Fang Xuanling 房玄齡 Fang Qiao (579 - 648), as the lead editor, drawing mostly from official documents left from earlier archives. A few essays in volumes 1, 3, 54 and 80 were composed by the Tang dynasty's Emperor Taizong himself. However, the contents of the Book of Jin included not only the history of the Jin dynasty, but also that of the Sixteen Kingdoms period, which was contemporaneous with the Eastern Jin dynasty."@en ;

The artist Echo Morgan, after colouring her body white, writes Chinese characters in red ink all over her body. She writes the character \"ta 她\"(she/her) on her face and her body becomes a scroll of \"patriarchal text\". The artist decides to cover her body with some derogatory and insulting words associated with the character \"nü 女\" (female), such as: \"jian 奸\" (rape); \"nuan 奻\" (stupid); \"jian 姦\" (evil); \"yao 妖\" (demon); \"biao 婊\"(bitch); \"piao 嫖\"(brothe); \"pin 姘\"(mistress); \"chang 娼\"(whore); \"ji 妓\"(prostitute); \"nu 奴\"(slave); \"shua 耍\"(play); \"lan 婪\"(greed); \"ning 佞\"(insincerity); \"wang 妄\" (foolish); \"yu 娱\"(entertainment); \"xian 嫌\"(fedup); \"fang 妨\"(harm); \"ji 嫉\" (envy) ; \"du 妒\" (jealous); \"bi 妣\" (dead mother); \"ban 姅\" (miscarriage). She also covers her body with famous Chinese saying such as: “Three Obediences and Four Virtues” (san cong si de 三从四德); “A woman's virtue is to have no talent\" (nuzi wu cai bian shi de 女子无才便是德); \"Men are superior and women are inferior” (nan zun nu bei 男尊女卑); \"Beauty leads to disaster/femme fatale” (hongyanhuoshui 红颜祸水)."@en ;

This artwork was created during the performance which took place in the same year. Wu Xixia reconciles personal identity and gender and carries out a reflection on women and herself, writing the labels of society’s goodwill and malice towards women with red ink, such as \"whore\" (biao zi 婊子) \"old maid\" (lao chunu 老处女), \"good wife and loving mother\" (xian qiliang mu 贤妻良母), \"green tea bitch\" (luchabiao 绿茶婊), \"teenage girl\" (yunu 玉女), \"white lotus\" (bailian hua 白莲花), etc. She answers questions such as: \"Who are women? And who am I? Is my gender determined by birth or is it given by society? There is a womb here, but where is the \"mother\"?\". Having been rejected by her family at the time of her birth as a female, she has been questioning her gender throughout her formative years, and the social labels she writes about are an attempt to reconcile herself with her gender identity."@en ;

It consists of the characters written by Wu Xixia inside an inflatable hermetic sphere during the performance that took place in 2020. In this performance, Wu Xixia carries out a reflection on women and herself, writing the labels of society’s goodwill and malice towards women in red paint, such as \"whore\" (biao zi 婊子) \"old maid\" (lao chunu 老处女), \"good wife and loving mother\" (xian qiliang mu 贤妻良母), \"green tea bitch (luchabiao 绿茶婊), \"teenage girl\" (yunu 玉女), \"white lotus\" (bailian hua 白莲花) etc. She answers questions such as: \"Who are women? And who am I? Is my gender determined by birth or is it given by society? There is a womb here, but where is the \"mother\"?\" Having been rejected by her family at the time of her birth as a female, she has been questioning her gender throughout her formative years, and the social labels she writes about are an attempt to reconcile herself with her gender identity."@en ;

    ns2:title "Darling" ;
    ns3:description "\"Darling\" is an artwork used for the installation exposed in Beijing in 2021 in occasion of the \"Xixia Wu Personal Art Exhibition\" (Wu Xixia ge zhan 吴析夏个展 - December 6 to 20, 2021). It is artwork created by Wu Xixia during the performance which took place in the same year in front of a building called \"Darling\". The building was covered with red ribbons, which spread all the way to the inflatable ball. Wu Xixia writes the words \"jiu jiu wo 救救我\" (help me); \"qiuqiu ni 求求你\" (I beg you), \"bie sha wo 别杀我\" (don't kill me); \"bie S wo 别S我\" (don't fuck me), etc. inside the hermetic sphere. The female body becomes an object of desire and \"objectification\" under the male gaze. In the process of doing performance art, passers-by, especially men, took photos with various poses and angles nearby. In the course of more than 40 minutes, the artist lay quietly on the ground to receive everyone’s gaze, to begin to write down the words for help. Red gives a signal of judgment, and the red ribbon is the concretization of the female body being stared at. The building covered with red ribbons symbolize the existing and massive examination of the female body. The artist wraps the red ribbon of the building on the inflatable ball, representing the current situation of women who are looking at fearlessly and pursuing physical freedom, but it is still difficult to escape from the scrutiny. In the past, the female body has always been hidden. Nowadays, with the awakening of female consciousness, women break free from the shackles and turn from invisibility to openness and fearless publicity. In this transition, the female body is no longer a private and invisible object, but exposed to the public eye. Just as the protagonist of this performance art puts herself under public scrutiny, it is a challenge, but cannot escape scrutiny. This performance aims to arouse people's attention to the predicament of women breaking free from physical examination (wuwei shenshi 无畏审视)."@en ;

Many strokes are replaced by round dots (which do not belong to the category of strokes used in Chinese writing to compose characters) which recall the form of musical notes.

    ns2:title "Dance Remains Series (舞迹系列)" ;
    ns3:description """This series was created by the artist Jessie Yingying Gong in 2018, during the six months of the artist residency at the "Swatch Art Peace Hotel" in Shanghai. “Dance Remains” is a series of long exposure photographs the artist made of public dancers (both men and women) in various parks around Shanghai in the evening, after asking them to attach LED lights on their bodies while dancing. The artist captured around 80 photographs and in eight of them, the result appears as if dancers are writing an abstract secret language with the movement of their bodies, resembling some characters written in Nüshu 女书, such as "xin 心 (heart)"; "bei 背" (sadness); "shui 水" (water) and "xiao 小" (small).
This for the artist evokes the times when the female population gathered together to sing songs and do embroidery in the Nüshu village. By combining these photographs with the flowy Nüshu characters, she intends to form a poetic visual compilation of photography and writing."""@en ;

    ns3:description "In this series, Jessie Yingying Gong explores the subject of public exercise, this time spotlighting Taiji. This traditional form of Chinese martial arts incorporates routine and movement, breathing and mindfulness, along with the ideological balancing of the forces of yin and yang. In this binary, movement generates \"yang 阳\"; tranquility ultimately generates \"yin 阴\". The concept of Qi, the flow of energy, is essential to Taiji practice. It is the language used to pinpoint how the internal arts feels – an imagined communication between the mind and the body. In \"Away with the Flow\", the artist wants to visualize and manifest the bodily sensations in Taiji through a variety of media, involving photography, calligraphy, installation, visual poetry, video, and live performance."@en ;

    ns2:title "New Semiotics Series (新符号学系列)" ;
    ns3:description "In this series, starting in 2017 and ongoing, Jessie Yingying Gong compares  two ancient styles of writing: \"Linear B\", that was a syllabic script used for writing in Mycenaean Greek, the earliest attested form of Greek and \"oracle bone script\", used anciently in China. The letters and characters of an alphabet began as depictions of daily objects and at first, signified those alone. In time they came to represent syllables or sounds. In the Chinese written language, this is particularly evident, as the original memory of meaning is still visible. A study into the Greek history showed that it also exists in very early manifestations of the western alphabet. Linear B is a form of ancient Greek dating from the Mycenaean civilization. This half pictographic, half syllabic language surprisingly bears much similarity with the ancient Chinese oracle bone script. Studying the ancient languages and their semiotics, looking at how images transform into symbols that represent words and concepts, this project is to explore this resemblance of linguistic history - how each of them and their meanings evolved through time, and how two very different cultures began their rich literary traditions from a similar elementary starting point. The contrasts and similarities is brought to life with lively neon signs and playful clay figurines depicting and representing those ancient languages. These letters and symbols are something foreign and alien, yet they are the foundation of something very familiar and recognisable. The contrasts and similarities of linguistic history is brought to life with lively neon signs and playful clay figurines. Jessie Yingying Gong idealized Chinese characters in oracle bone script, such as: \"xue 学\" (study); \"xi 喜\" (happiness); \"meng 梦\" (dream); \"yi 艺\" (arts and crafts), etc."@en ;

    ns2:title "Enfolding Series" ;
    ns3:description """This series is divided into two parts:
- Part 1. In this part, the series conceptualized by Jessie Yingying Gong consists of the combination of Chinese characters which became “folded” into Chinese Nüshu and Japanese Onnade respectively.  “Women’s Writing”, Nüshu in Chinese, is a writing system developed by and only passed on among the female population of small villages in South Hunan Province. Derived from square Chinese characters and local symbols, Nüshu takes on a whimsical shape, looking almost like dancing figures. “Women’s Hand”, Onnade in Japanese, is a simplified writing style developed by women from Chinese cursive script, (later known as Hiragana), while Kanji was dominantly practiced by men at the time, and used to write official documents. The lenticular installation realized by Jessie Yingying Gong, demonstrates how one Chinese character became “folded” into Chinese Nüshu (Women’s Writing) and Japanese Onnade (Women’s Hand). respectively. According to the artist, it is the union between the Nushu and the Onnade that creates the Chinese character (or Kanji), underlining how the Chinese character is the element of universal connection and communication between the two worlds.
- Part 2. In this part, Jessie Yingying Gong conceptualized different lenticulars which demonstrate how Chinese characters became “folded” into the Japanese Onnade. In Japan, women developed a simplified writing style from Chinese cursive script, known as Onnade, meaning “Women’s Hand” (later known as Hiragana).
For both part 1 and part 2 the characters are designed on the computer first, by cutting each character (of the pair) into vertical strips, then stitching the strips one next to the other. By folding the sheet several times, an optical effect is obtained in which the two characters appear to join each other. 
Onnade and Nüshu appeared and manifested themselves in distinct ways. Eventually Onnade gained the upper hand and became the accepted form of writing together with Kanji, while Chinese Nüshu is now a dying practice considered cultural heritage. Yet together they tell the story of our shared history and memory — how women in different countries gave themselves a voice in a restricted and patriarchal environment, and how our communities and societies are connected through this resourceful act of defiance."""@en ;

    ns3:description "The “Lotus Sūtra” (Miaofa lianhua jing 妙法蓮華經) is one of the most influential and venerated Buddhist Mahāyāna sūtras.  It was composed by Kumarajiva (344 or 350 – 413), a Buddhist monk, scholar, missionary and translator from the Kingdom of Kucha (present-day Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang, China) between 263–62. The shortened Chinese title given by the monk is \"Fahua jing 法華經\" (Dharma Exalted Sutra). Two central teachings of the Lotus Sūtra have been very influential for Mahāyāna Buddhism. The first is the doctrine of the “One Vehicle”, which says that all Buddhist paths and practices lead to Buddhahood and so they are all merely \"skillful means\" of reaching Buddhahood. The second is the idea that the lifespan of the Buddha is immeasurable and that therefore, he did not really pass on into final Nirvana (he only appeared to do so as upāya) but is still active teaching the Dharma. Another important teaching of the “Lotus Sūtra” is that all beings can become Buddhas."@en ;

It consists on the 30-meters long volume of the Fahua Sutra which was hanged in the museum space. Li Xinmo writes Scriptures as a replacement for woman, giving rise to a feminist perspective. In her opinion, Buddha is a symbol of the equality of all living beings, but also transcends gender. Reading and writing Buddhist sutras was her early lesson.

Infact, he uses a tecnique that wants to reproduce the ephimeral nature of the raindrops. For doing this he firstly used a brush full of ink on a plastic sheet, creating droplets on its non-absorbent surface. Then, using a dry brush and the ink droplets left on the plastic sheet, he wrote these four verses of the Heart Sutra. Finally, he positioned a sheet of rice paper on the written plastic sheet, transferring the traced content from the plastic to the paper."@en ;

It consists of some big traditional characters of the famous Chinese dictionary named \"Shuowen Jiezi 说文解字\" realized by Xu Shen (c. 58 – c. 148 CE). These characters are accompained with their explanations written in smaller size. These big characters with female radical have all a negative meaning, for example: \"hai 妎\" (jealous/demanding); \"fu 妇\" (woman/wife); \"wang 妄\" (presumptuous/rash); \"lan 婪\" (be greedy); \"fang 妨\" (harm), \"hun 婚\" (married), \"yin 婬\" (lascivious/licentious); \"ning 佞\" (sycophant/toady); \"du 妒\" (jealous/envy); \"qu 娶\" (take a wife); \"wei 委\" (throw away/cast aside); \"zi 姊\" (older sister) etc. This also shows the misogynistic and derogatory nature of the Chinese cultural tradition towards women."@en ;

    ns3:description """This Visual Artwork consists of the digital calligraphic piece realized by Wang Dongling during the performance "Calligraphy generated by body data" in 2021. The title and the content of this digital artwork corresponds to the first chapter of Zhuangzi,  titled “A Carefree Excursion“ (Xiaoyao you 逍遥).  The artist writes the content of the first chapter with the support of Augmented Reality technology adopting his distinctive style called "Entangled Script" (luanshu 乱书). "The digital brushstrokes are continually being generated, entangled, and disentangled from one another, and they are connected with both the ancient past and the future. The "Chaos" of "Chaos-Writing" consists in its penetrating through calligraphy's state of torpor with the power of confusion and disorder, in its focus on the essence of the inner structure and "openness" of writing itself, in bringing back to life the original, generative power of calligraphy." (Gao 2021, p. 350).
This calligraphy is a three-dimensional trace of movement of the writing. The usual materiel and tools of calligraphy (paper, ink, brush) are not adopted, leaving room to digital and technological tools, which are used to create virtual, intangible and transcendent. It is important to notice that the artwork is not realized only by the calligrapher, as  has happened in the past, but by a team of engineers/producers able to help the artist create the digital artwork, and therefore it involves a plurality of actors as in performances."""@en ;

The artist used cursive and clerical scripts on the bamboo poles to write poems from the Classic of Poetry (Shijing 诗经), some lines from the famous \"Encountering Sorrow“ (Li sao 离骚) and from other historical lyrics about the bamboo from past dynasties. To replace ink Wang Dongling adopt a writing fluid made up of  kneading oil  (nieyou 捏油 ), a special oil used to protect Moso bamboo, mixing with acrylic paint on 201 bamboo poles with a height of 5 meters and a diameter of 15 centimeters.  Wang Dongling adopted the clerical script only on one pole, which makes a clear reference to the Qin and Han dynasties. During these two dynasties, strips of bamboo or wood  written in clerical script and represented the main media for writing documents before the introduction of paper.  Wang  used his Entangled Script (luanshu 乱书) on the transparent sheets."@en ;

(泰山成砥砺, 黄河为裳带). It represents ten huge characters of different dimensions.

(Reference of the collection is the Fan Qin/Chen Dewen edition). 
n the visual result given by the ten monumental characters of View from Heaven, and in particular in the last character of the verse (from 带), which is projected onto the entire size of the last panel, we notice the influence by one of the currents of Japanese calligraphic art, called Few-characters current (shao zi pai 少字派) and in particular by Inoue Yuichi (井上有一, 1916-1985) on the art of Wang Dongling, who began writing monumental characters in his studio in 1985. The artist was also "inspired by the large characters of Sha Menghai“ (王冬龄创作手机, 2011 page 47). "The work gives the viewers an impression as if they were facing gigantic pieces of cliff inscriptions on the northern mountains. The ten huge characters in Cursive Script exhibit a remarkable vigorand innate solidity and exuberance as if they travelled through eternity, with a cosmic solitude facing heaven and earth alone, as well as a mountain-moving and ocean-filling power.” (Gao Shiming, p. XI).

    ns3:description "This Calli-Writing Unit consists of the large character Qi 氣 (Gas) written in traditional form, in a Wild and 3D graffiti style. This character is the tag of the artist: the choice of this character is related to the importance that this word/concept has in Chinese culture.  Literally meaning \"vapor\", \"air\", or \"breath\", the word Qi is often translated as \"vital energy\", \"vital force\", \"material energy\", or simply as \"energy\" because it is believed to be a vital force forming part of any living entity. In the traditional Chinese concept, qi is recognized as da qi 大氣 (great energy or energy of the macrocosm) and xi qi 吸氣 (breath). Originally, the da qi would have descended, giving birth to the earth; so the rain is understood as the \"qi of the earth\", which, becoming rarefied, would have risen, giving birth to the heaven. The human being, who is between heaven and earth, has both manifestations of da qi: the heavier one forms the body, the lighter one forms the heart. The idea of qi is also connected to another fundamental traditional Chinese concept, that of xing 行 (phase, process). The concept of the wu xing 五行 (five elements, more precisely defined as \"the five processes\") describes nature as the set of the five elements that compose it (fire, water, metal, wood and earth) and as a consequence of the relationships that occur between them. Referring to these two fundamental concepts of Chinese culture (qi and xing), the artist highlights, in the choice of his very name, how his will is to instil oriental \"breath\" in his art. The piece has a thick white outline. Every stroke has various layers of colors from dark to light blue, from dark to light purple, from dark to light brown and from dark to light green. The character has two backgrounds: the first is a grey \"bubble-cloud\", the second is a black wall. This character seems to reproduce a calligraphic seal of contemporary times: like a traditional seal, it is the sign of the artist, and it is characterized by angular strokes."@en ;

The graffiti has been spotted at many places on the streets of Hong Kong, ranging from lampposts, utility boxes, pillars, pavements, street furniture, and building walls, to an occasional car.  His family disowned him, saying he was mentally unbalanced and a public nuisance.

    ns3:description "LIN Hwai-min attended Chun Wen Elementary School in Chiayi for one year before transferring to Taichung First High School. He next moved to Weido, a private Catholic Brothers’ boy school. His father encouraged him to take on law studies at the National Chengchi University but after a year, he switched majors to journalism. Graduating with a degree in journalism, Lin was drafted into the army with an office job in communications in Taipei. In the 1960s, when modern dance was gaining popularity in Taiwan, Lin enrolled in a dance studio. Later on, Lin attended workshops by renowned dancers such as Chungliang Al Huang and Yen Lo-Wong. In 1969, Lin left for the United States on a scholarship to study journalism at the University of Missouri. At Missouri, he received a fellowship to the University of Iowa’s International Writing Program to study under renowned poet, Paul Engle. At UI, he participated actively in theatre and fine arts. He also attended a Modern Dance course taught by Marcia Thayer. Lin would later on refer to her strong passion and dedication to the art of dance as an important influence. It is from this increased involvement in dance and fine arts that he sharpened his interest and enrolled in a summer course at Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance in New York, where he would later on spend most of his time upon receiving his master's degree from Iowa to hone his artistic skills and knowledge. When Lin returned to Taiwan in the 1970s, he started writing and choreographing as well as teaching at the National Chengchi University and the Chinese Cultural University. He founded \"Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan\" in 1973 and retired at the end of 2019, appointing CHENG Tsung-lung the company’s new Artistic Director. Celebrated by Time magazine as one of Asia’s Heroes, he has led this company to international prominence through his thrilling creations that transform Asian aesthetics into contemporary celebration of motion. LIN has created over 90 choreographic pieces, many of which have left an indelible imprint on the audience’s memories, such as LEGACY, NINE SONGS, MOON WATER, RICE, SONGS OF THE WANDERERS, and “Cursive: A Trilogy”—CURSIVE, PINE SMOKE, and WILD CURSIVE. In 2019, his FORMOSA was selected by the Guardian as one of the Top 20 “Best Dances of the 21st Century.” In 1983, he created the Department of Dance at Taipei National University of the Arts and since 2000, he has been serving as the Artistic Director of the Novel Dance Series for the Novel Hall dance venue in Taipei. Lin often assimilates old forms of dance with contemporary style and interpretation. He has composed many original works as well as modified and adapted classical works from Peking opera. He incorporates different art forms into his pieces and marries Western and Eastern aesthetics and style into a distinct fusion signature of the Cloud Gate Company. He is famous for his ability to seamlessly integrate different styles such as ballet, traditional Chinese opera, Buddhist meditation and martial arts like tai chi as well as Taiwanese aborigines ritual dance into his choreographic works. He immerses himself in the study of Asian culture, such as studying court dance in Seoul in 1975 as well as spending quality time throughout his career in Bali to observe local rituals and ceremonies. Furthermore, most of his works would include themes that relate closely to Taiwan. At the beginning of his career, he was deeply concerned with political changes in his home country and he was also aware of the rise of Taiwanese consciousness. He felt responsible to compose pieces to reflect Taiwan’s history as this also intimately relate to his own past and upbringing. He draws inspiration from diverse sources of artistic styles to create unique contemporary dance movements that reflected Taiwan society's complexity. The dynamic Chinese and Japanese experiences of his family (and Taiwan's colonial past), his western education in the United States as well as his vast knowledge on Asian and Taiwanese Aboriginal traditional cultures and rituals all contributed significantly in helping him form his artistic vision of Taiwan."@en ;

    ns3:description "TONG Yang-Tze is one of Taiwan’s most important modern-day artists. At the beginning of her childhood, she started studying calligraphy with her father. Later on, she studied arts at high school with the well-known painter Chang Ku-nien 張穀年 (1906-1987). In 1966, she graduated from the Fine Arts Department of National Normal University of Taiwan. Three years later, she started a Master of Arts at University of Massachusetts, USA. She also studied oil painting at the Brooklyn Collage. Following her return to Taiwan, she began experimenting with fusing Western theories of painting with the lines and strokes that are the backbone of Chinese calligraphy. TONG Yang-Tze is practically famous for her large-scale calligraphic pieces done in cursive script, with her work often described as vigorous, bold and unrestrained. The structure of her characters and their lay out reveal a uniquely modern interpretation and serve as the basis for a new calligraphic style. Over the past few years, TONG Yang-Tze has worked to promote the art of Chinese script, fusing the aesthetics of calligraphy with modern day lifestyles and visual art. Examples include collaboration with the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, Kingstone Books Cultural Plaza, Taipei Main Station, the arrival/departure stamps used by Taiwan’s National Immigration Agency, the documentary Beyond Beauty—Taiwan From Above, and the character for ‘blessing’—part of the lunar couplet given to shoppers at eslite bookstores throughout Taiwan in celebration of the Chinese New Year. A full-time artist for over 40 years, TONG Yang-Tze has held over 60 calligraphy shows worldwide. In recent years, her focus has shifted to crossover exhibitions, using the medium of the calligraphic form and content to “re-introduce” the Chinese script to the public and highlighting its place in the modern world. Some of her most important exhibitions include: Ink Like Gold; Heart Strings–The Sounds of Silence; Dialogues, X beyond O: Calligraphy – Sign – Space; Eternal Rhythm of Ink; Silent Music; One Character: Honesty; and Solitary Joy. Some of her most important crossover exhibitions include: Chasing Spirit; SAO; CHEN; From Ink to Apparel-A Crossover between Calligraphy Art and Fashion Design. TONG Yang-Tze’s bold crossover experiments look to bring to life the beauty of calligraphy in the internet age and to ensure that the artistic beauty of the Chinese script finds its way into modern day dialogues—thus continuing the contemporary brilliance of this ancient Eastern tradition."@en ;

    ns3:description "This visual artwork is a projected freeze frame. It consists of a beitie 碑帖 (a rubbing of an inscribed script on stone) of the white cursive words on a black background reproducing the poem entitled “Li Sao 离骚” (Encountering Sorrow) realized by Mi fu 米芾 (1051–1107). This is an ancient Chinese poem from the anthology Chuci traditionally attributed to Qu Yuan 屈原 (c. 340 – 278). This calligraphy was projected during the dance performance \"Cursive I\" (2001). On the dark stage, the dancers’ skin becomes a surface that absorbs light and reveals the calligraphic characters. As the dancers move their torsos, the characters become “liquid”, flowing over their skin. When the characters touch the dancers’ skin, the characters become brighter. A red circle faded in on the stage while the dancers transited into lower still postures, with the whole stage’s lighting faded out. "@en ;

My late honored sire bore the name of Bo-yong.
The she-ti stars aimed to the year's first month;
Geng-yin was the day that I came down.

He scanned and delved into my first measure,
From the portents my sire gave these noble names:
The name that he gave me was Upright Standard;
And my title of honor was Godly Poise.

Such bounty I had of beauty within,
And to this was added fair countenance.
I wore mantles of river rush and remote angelica,
Strung autumn orchids to hang from my sash.

I knelt with robes open, thus stated my case,
Having grasped so clearly what is central and right.
I teamed jade white dragons, rode the Bird that Hides Sky,
Waiting on winds to fleetly fare upward.

At dawn I loosed wheel-block there by Cang-wu,
And by twilight I reached the Gardens of Air.
I wished to bide a while by the windows of gods,
But swift was the sun and it soon would be dusk.

I bade sun-driver Xi-he, to pause in her pace,
To stand off from Yan-zi and not to draw night.
On and on stretched my road, long it was and far,
I would go high and go low in this search that I made.

I watered my horses in the Pools of Xian,
And twisted the reins on the tree Fu-sang,
I snapped a branch of the Ruo Tree to block out the sun,
I roamed freely the while and lingered there.

Those men of faction had ill-gotten pleasures,
Their paths went in shadow, narrow, unsafe.
Not for myself came this dread of doom—
I feared my king's chariot soon would be tipped.

In haste I went dashing in front and behind,
Till I came to the tracks of our kings before.
Lord Iris did not fathom my nature within,
He believed ill words, he glowered in rage.

I knew well my bluntness had brought me these woes,
Yet I bore through them, I could not forswear.
I pointed to Heaven to serve as my warrant,
It was all for the cause of the Holy One.

It is now done forever!
In all the kingdom there is no man, no man who knows me,
Then why should I care for that city, my home?
Since no one will join me in making good rule,
I will go off to seek where Peng and Xian dwell."""@en,

    ns3:description "Sainkho Namtchylak is a singer originally from Tuva, an autonomous republic in the Russian Federation just north of Mongolia. She is known for her Tuvan throat singing[1] or Khöömei.Namtchylak is an experimental singer, born in 1957 in a secluded village in the south of Tuva. She is proficient in overtone singing; her music encompasses avant-jazz, electronica, modern composition and Tuvan influences. In Tuva, numerous cultural influences collide: the Turkic roots and culture it shares with Central Asian states, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Bashkortostan and Tatarstan; the strong Mongolic cultural influence and traditions it shares with Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Buryatia and Kalmykia; the cultural influences from the various Siberian nomadic ethnic groups such as Samoyeds, Yeniseians, Evenks and from the Russian Old Believers, the migrant and resettled populations from Ukraine, Tatarstan and other minority groups west of the Urals. All of these, to extents, impact on Namtchylak's voice, although the Siberian influences dominate: her thesis produced while studying voice, first at the University of Kyzyl, then in the Gnesins Institute in Moscow during the 1980s focussed on Lamaistic and cult musics of minority groups across Siberia, and her music frequently shows tendencies towards Tungus-style imitative singing."@en ;

    ns3:description "This artwork is produced during the performance \"Desire for Procreation and Life (渴望生命)\" held on August 14, 2010 at the Tap Seac Museum of Art in Macao. Accompanied by a female musician playing the cello, Pu Lieping reflects on the life drive of man and even more of woman, and introduces the element of dance, through a pregnant dancer who accompanies the notes of a cello played by a female musician. The artist writes the four characters \"Shengming zhi yun 生命之韵\" (Rhythm of Life) both on paper and also on the pregnant dancer's white clothes. Through this performance, Pu Lieping tries to interpret Chinese character art through the senses of sight, hearing, and body language."@en ;

    ns3:trascription-or-translation """"Mit diesen Händen, die abends das Kreuzzeichen auf die Stirn deines Kindes zeichnen, hast du den Abzug des Maschinengewehrs um jene entscheidenden Millionstel Millimeter verrückt, sodaß er die Stirne anderer und Unschuldiger zerschmettere. Mit diesen Händen hast du die Kippen der Neger aufgelesen, hast du viele, viele Brote zerschnitten und gegessen und viele viele tausend Male den Suppenlöffel zum Munde geführt...

Mit diesen Händen hast du die schmierigen Gläser in rumänischen Kneipen und die sauberen Gläser in flämischen Kneipen zum Munde geführt, mit diesen Händen hast du manchen Aperitif in dich hineingeschüttet und manche Flasche Wein an den Hals gehalten...

Mit diesen Händen hast du die Schuhe von einer schwarzen Russenleiche gezogen, da deine zerfetzt waren, mit diesen Händen hast du in den Taschen der Toten nach Machorka gesucht, da der Hunger dir den Bauch auftrieb...

Mit diesen Händen hast du den Stacheldraht angefaßt, dich schmerzhaft ins Fleisch schneidend, hast dir die Finger blutig gerissen, weil dein ganzer Körper vor Hunger schrie, wenn drüben die Eiersuppe mit Benzin übergossen und vernichtet wurde.
Mit diesen Händen hast du manches tiefe Loch in die dunkle russische Erde gegraben, hast du in tiefster Dunkelheit gierig und hastig das Kochgeschirr mit Suppe oder Kaffee zum Mund geführt, mit diesen Händen hast du den Leutnant ins Gesicht geschlagen, eine Minute bevor er fiel...

Diese Hände haben geschachert, du hast den Stoff der Hose oder des Mantels, die du verscheuern wolltest, damit prüfend und preisend berührt und hast die Geldscheine mit diesen Händen in Empfang genommen...
Viel, viel Geld ist durch diese Hände gegangen, Geld für die Straßenbahn und für Tabak und Schnaps. Du hast mit diesen Händen Geld zum Schwarzmarkt gebracht, alles mit diesen Händen.

Mit diesen Händen hast du nicht den, sondern die Faust in der Tasche gehalten, mit diesen Händen hast du die Portieren zu vornehmen Hotels und zu düsteren Kneipen geöffnet, du hast diese Hände im Atlantik gewaschen und in den Fluten der Schwarzmeeres. Viele haben diese Hände empfangen und wenig gegeben.

Du hast die Erde zerbröckelt damit und hast dir ein Stück deines Hemdes damit abgerissen, weil die Hose voll war. Du hast Urlaubsscheine damit gefälscht und hast falsche Namen damit geschrieben, um Butterbrote oder Zigaretten auf trostlosen Bahnhöfen zu erschleichen. Diese Hände haben unzählige Zigaretten gedreht aus russischem Tabak, deutschem Tabak, aus Kippen und aus feinstem amerikanischen Tabak. Diese Hände hast du millionenmal gewaschen und immer wieder waren sie sauber, rein und unschuldig und kein Mensch hat sich gefürchtet, sie anzufassen, obwohl du tödliche Granaten damit in den Trichter des Werfers gesteckt hast.

Du hast damit Papierkügelchen zum Pult des Lehrers geschossen, hast sie an dem ewig lädierten Füllfederhalter beschmutzt und zu einer Zeit, die du nicht mehr kennst, hast du die Brüste deiner Mutter damit berührt, du hast die Schulmappe damit umklammert, von vielerlei Blut waren sie befleckt, schwarz von geronnenem Blut, das die Poren verstopfte, Blut von ihm, oder Blut von dir, sie waren wie Metzgerhände, diese Hände, die dein Kind abends im Spiel mit seinem unschuldigen Mund berührt, wenn du das Zeichen des Kreuzes auf seine Stirn zeichnest."

"""@de,
        """"With these hands that draw the sign of the cross on your child's forehead in the evening, you have shifted the machine gun trigger by those crucial millionths of a millimeter so that it shattered the foreheads of others and innocent people. With those hands you picked up the butts of negroes, you did you cut up and ate many, many loaves of bread and put the soup spoon to your mouth many many thousands of times...

With these hands you brought the greasy glasses to your mouth in Romanian pubs and the clean glasses in Flemish pubs, with these hands you poured many an aperitif and held many a bottle of wine to your neck...

With these hands you pulled the shoes off a black Russian corpse because yours were in tatters, with these hands you searched for Makhorka in the pockets of the dead because hunger was bloating your stomach...

You grabbed the barbed wire with those hands, cutting your flesh painfully, tearing your fingers bloody because your whole body screamed with hunger when the egg soup over there was doused with petrol and destroyed.

With these hands you dug many a deep hole in the dark Russian earth, in the depths of darkness you greedily and hastily brought the cookware with soup or coffee to your mouth, with those hands you slapped the lieutenant in the face a minute before he fell. ..

These hands haggled, you touched the fabric of the trousers or coat that you wanted to discard, examining and praising it, and you received the banknotes with these hands...
Lots and lots of money passed through these hands, money for the streetcar and for tobacco and liquor. You brought money to the black market with those hands, all with those hands.

With these hands you held not that but your fist in your pocket, with these hands you opened the doors to elegant hotels and gloomy pubs, you washed these hands in the Atlantic and in the waters of the Black Sea. Many have received these hands and given little.

You crumbled the earth with it and ripped off a piece of your shirt with it because your pants were full. You used it to forge holiday vouchers and use them to write false names in order to swindle sandwiches or cigarettes from desolate train stations. These hands rolled countless cigarettes from Russian tobacco, German tobacco, butts and the finest American tobacco. You have washed these hands a million times and again and again they were clean, pure and innocent and no one was afraid to touch them, even though you used them to put deadly grenades into the launcher's funnel.

You shot little balls of paper with it to the teacher's desk, you soiled them on the eternally damaged fountain pen and at a time that you no longer remember you touched your mother's breasts with it, you clutched your school satchel with it, they were of all kinds of blood stained black with clotted blood clogging the pores, blood from him, or blood from you, they were like butcher's hands, those hands that your child touches with his innocent mouth at play at night when you make the sign of the cross on his forehead draw.\""""@en ;

Together with the Chinese calligrapher and artist Gu Gan, friend of Huang Miaozi, he organized an exhibition of their works, held at the Museum für Ostasiatische Kunst in Cologne at the end of 1992. This exhibition was the first major modern Chinese calligraphy exhibition held in Europe or the United States and Huang's "Mit diesen Händen" represents the most memorable piece from this exhibition. The title of this artwork, inspired by Heinrich Böll's poem "Mit diesen Händen", gave also the name to the exhibition. The artwork reminded Huang Miaozi of the hard times faced while living in China. On the purple print of an open hand, he wrote part of the poem in the archaic Seal Script of the Shang-Zhou period. According to Barrass (2002 p. 178), this is the only example of his works that Huang refused to sell.

    ns3:description "The text of CWU2 of the Artwork 'Dance' consists of the text based on the poem  \"Watching Gongsun Daniang’s Students perform Sword Dance\" (Guān gōngsūn dàniáng dìzǐ wǔ jiàn qì xíng 观公孙大娘弟子舞剑器行) written by Du Fu after having seen a group of disciples of Gongsun Daniang, a famous sword dancer, performing; the poet recalled having seen the sword whirling lady dancer in his youth, when he was only 27 years of age (year 739).  In the preface to the poem, Du Fu wrote about the calligrapher Zhang Xu, whose cursive script greatly advanced after having seen Gongsun Daniang’s sword dance. Du Fu’s poem was widely distributed  in handwritten copies, in print and in illustrated prints. Therefore, correlation between (sword) dance, calligraphy (specifically the cursive script) and performance firmly established  since the eighth century. In the year 767, the poet Du Fu saw a group of students of the famous sword dancer Gongsun Daniang perform; recalled having seen the sword whirling lady dancer in his youth, when he was  only 27 years of age (year 739); mentioned the calligrapher Zhang Xu 張旭 (ac. ca. 700-750)."@en ;
    ns3:trascription-or-translation """(preface)
On the 19th of the Tenth-month in the second year of Dali, I saw, in the house of the Kueifu official Yuante, a girl named Li from Lingying dancing with a dagger. I admired her skill and asked who was her teacher. She named Lady Gongsun. I remembered that in the third year of Kaiyuan at Yancheng, when I was a little boy, I saw Lady Gongsun dance. She was the only one in the Imperial Theatre who could dance with this weapon. Now she is aged and unknown, and even her pupil has passed the heyday of beauty. I wrote this poem to express my wistfulness. The work of Zhang Xu, a native from the Wu district, as good at cursive calligraphyas good at cursive calligraphy. He often mentioned Mrs. Gongsun dancing with swords in Ye County. From then on, his cursive writing improved and he became bold and grateful. From this may be judged the art of Gongsun. 

(poem)
There lived years ago the beautiful Gongsun, 
Who, dancing with her dagger, drew from all four quarters 
An audience like mountains lost among themselves. 
Heaven and earth moved back and forth, following her motions, 
Which were bright as when the Archer shot the nine suns down the sky 
And rapid as angels before the wings of dragons. 
She began like a thunderbolt, venting its anger, 
And ended like the shining calm of rivers and the sea.... 
But vanished are those red lips and those pearly sleeves; 
And none but this one pupil bears the perfume of her fame, 
This beauty from Lingying, at the Town of the White God, 
Dancing still and singing in the old blithe way. 
And while we reply to each other's questions, 
We sigh together, saddened by changes that have come. 
There were eight thousand ladies in the late Emperor's court, 
But none could dance the dagger-dance like Lady Gongsun. 
Fifty years have passed, like the turning of a palm; 
Wind and dust, filling the world, obscure the Imperial House. 
Instead of the Pear-Garden Players, who have blown by like a mist, 
There are one or two girl-musicians now-trying to charm the cold Sun. 
There are man-size trees by the Emperor's Golden Tomb 
I seem to hear dead grasses rattling on the cliffs of Qutang. 
The song is done, the slow string and quick pipe have ceased. 
At the height of joy, sorrow comes with the eastern moon rising. 
And I, a poor old man, not knowing where to go, 
Must harden my feet on the lone hills, toward sickness and despair.

大曆二年十月十九日，夔府別駕元持宅，見臨潁李十二孃舞劍器，壯其蔚跂，問其所師，曰：“餘公孫大娘弟子也。” 開元五載，餘尚童稚，記於郾城觀公孫氏，舞劍器渾脫，瀏漓頓挫，獨出冠時，自高頭宜春梨園二伎坊內人洎外供奉舞女，曉是舞者，聖文神武皇帝初，公孫一人而已。玉貌錦衣，況餘白首，今茲弟子，亦非盛顏。既辨其由來，知波瀾莫二，撫事慷慨，聊爲《劍器行》。
昔者吳人張旭，善草書帖，數常於鄴縣見公孫大娘舞西河劍器，自此草書長進，豪蕩感激，即公孫可知矣。

昔有佳人公孫氏，一舞劍器動四方。
觀者如山色沮喪，天地為之久低昂。
霍如羿射九日落，矯如群帝驂龍翔。
來如雷霆收震怒，罷如江海凝清光。
絳唇珠袖兩寂寞，晚有弟子傳芬芳。
臨潁美人在白帝，妙舞此曲神揚揚。
與余問答既有以，感時撫事增惋傷。
先帝侍女八千人，公孫劍器初第一。
五十年間似反掌，風塵傾動昏王室。
梨園弟子散如煙，女樂余姿映寒日。
金粟堆前木已拱，瞿唐石城草蕭瑟。
玳筵急管曲復終，樂極哀來月東出。
老夫不知其所往，足繭荒山轉愁疾。

1. in Hall A of OCAT Shenzhen more than 200 5-meter tall green bamboo stalks with Wang Dongling's calligraphic inscriptions have sprung up,  turning the warehouse-shaped art space into a bamboo grove. This installation gives the title to the exhibition. 
2. In Hall B, the artist is also exhibiting a large-scale calligraphy work  of “chaos script” on paper (8.4x5.5-meters). Excerpts  from poems by Ruan Ji and Ji Kang, were written vertically, so the whole work when hung on the wall resembles a magnificent waterfall.
3. Also in Hall B, Wang's 100 pieces of ink abstraction are on display along with a video documenting the artist's calligraphic work.

Wang Dongling used  bamboo as main support of his calligraphic work together with several transparent propylene panels written with white acrylic paint by Wang Dongling come across in the path among the bamboo poles, creating a dialogue between "calligraphy" and "bamboo" in the viewer's perception of wandering in the grove.

The poem is a seven-word quatrain in eight lines. Wang wrote in cursive script (cao shu 草书) the last two lines of the poem, for a total of 28 characters, which praise the beauty of West Lake (Xihu 西湖), one of the most famous scenic spots in China, which is compared to Xi Shi 西施, one of the “Four Great Beauties” (si da meinü 四大美女) of ancient China, women of rare beauty who lived in ancient times. These last two lines of the poem are widely circulated and are considered to be an appropriate comment on West Lake.
The painting on the 15 meters high x 33 meters wide wall is the largest size of Wang's original calligraphy work realized with blak ink and brush on paper. 
The colophon on the left side of the wall  reports the place of realization and the names of the poet and the artist:  "Poem by Su Dongpo, [written by] Wang Dongling in Hangzhou (Su Dongpo shi Wang Dongling yu Hangzhou 苏东坡诗王冬龄於杭州)".

The two poems praise the beauty of West Lake and were written during the poet’s tenure as the commander of Hangzhou.
The first poem is about the poet welcoming his guests in the morning sun and drinking with them in the evening rain, indulging in the rainy scenery of West Lake.

    ns3:description """The Calli-Writing Unit in the center of the piece is composed of four Chinese characters "Shen gong yi jiang 神工意匠": they are a Chinese "four-character idiom" (chengyu 成语). This chengyu also represents the title of the whole opera and it is an idiomatic expression used to describe the sublime beauty (exquisite conception and compositional structure) of a work of art (e.g. architectural buildings, paintings, etc.) shaped not only as a result of human capacities and labor, but also thanks to divine intervention.
This chengyu has taken inspiration from the last line of a poem composed by Zhao Puchu 赵朴初 (1907-2000) entitled Pingdeng Yuan 平等院  "Byōdō-in Temple". In this poem, Zhao Puchu describes the ecstatic sensation while contemplating the sublime beauty of the most beautiful building in the temple, the "Phoenix Hall" (Fenghuang Tang 凤凰堂), built about a thousand years before. He compares its solemn beauty to the literary peaks reached during the period of full literary grandeur in the Tang dynasty (618-907). In the poet’s vision, Buddhism overloaded those peaks, because the "divine breath added something that goes beyond what human nature requires" (shengongyijiang).
The piece is shaped using wildstyle and 3D style, it reproduces a European style (German colors) and recalls a regular script (kaishu 楷书).
The inner colors of the text are very simple but embellished with geometric decorative inlays. The first outline and the thickness of each character are black, the second double outline is red with glow effects, and the final, interrupted outline is yellow. The yellow line shape suggests the spiral movement of the clouds in the background, which reproduce the Chinese traditional decorative pattern called yunwen 云纹 (clouds pattern). Stylized drips are drawn into the clouds to add a graffiti effect to the whole composition. A dark grey shadow is finally drawn in the back of each character in order to underline the illusion of three-dimensional shape and space.

The text quoted in the calligraphy is the second stanza of an ancient poem entitled \"Rouged Lips\" (Dian Jiangchun 点绛唇). It was composed by Wang Yucheng 王禹偁 (954-1001), a famous poet/scholar of the Song dynasty (960-1279), during his exile in the South of the Empire, after being dismissed from his government position due to strong criticism against the policies of the time. In the poem, he expresses his sadness and despair, with nature becoming the mirror and voice of his deepest feelings: empathy with nature, pain for the unjust exile, pervasive loneliness and idyllic scenes are the central themes of the poem. These are recurrent themes in China’s lyric poetry of all times, and through this work they are revived in a fragment of contemporary urban art."@en ;

    ns3:description "This poem was composed by Wang Yucheng 王禹偁 (954-1001), a famous poet/scholar of the Song dynasty (960-1279), during his exile in the South of the Empire. In this poem, he expresses his inner emotions through a rich imaginary that allows him to skillfully establish similarities with nature. Empathy with nature, pain for an unjust exile, pervasive loneliness, and idyllic scenes are the central themes of the poem. These themes are recurrent in Chinese poetry of all times."@en ;

The southern shores still beautiful remain.
In riverside village flanked with fishermen’s fair,
A lonely wreath of slender smoke wafts in the air.
Afar a row of wild geese fly,
Weaving a letter in the sky.
What have I done in days gone by?
Gazing from the balustrade,
Could I weave my way as far as they?

Shariputra, form does not differ from emptiness; emptiness does not differ from form. Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself is form. So, too, are feeling, cognition, formation, and consciousness.
Shariputra, all dharmas are empty of characteristics. They are not produced. Not destroyed, not defiled, not pure, and they neither increase nor diminish.
Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, feeling, cognition, formation, or consciousness; no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no sights, sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, or dharmas; no field of the eyes, up to and including no field of mind-consciousness; and no ignorance or ending of ignorance, up to and including no old age and death or ending of old age and death. There is no suffering, no accumulating, no extinction, no way, and no understanding and no attaining.
Because nothing is attained, the Bodhisattva, through reliance on prajna paramita, is unimpeded in his mind. Because there is no impediment, he is not afraid, and he leaves distorted dream-thinking far behind. Ultimately Nirvana!
All Buddhas of the three periods of time attain Anuttarasamyaksambodhi through reliance on prajnaparamita. Therefore, know that prajna paramita is a great spiritual mantra, a great bright mantra, a supreme mantra, an unequaled mantra. It can remove all suffering; it is genuine and not false. That is why the mantra of prajna paramita was spoken. Recite it like this:
Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!

    ns3:description "The poem “Ink Bamboo” (Mo zhu 墨竹)  was written by the famous painter and calligrapher Jin Nong 金农 (1687–1763). In his paintings he generally used traditional images laden with symbolism, for example depicting “Four Gentlemen (Si junzi 四君子)” (orchids, bamboo, chrysanthemums, and mei blossoms) and preserved his independence by selling works in an open market, rather than adopting an individual patron. His calligraphy was also very reputed. His distinctive syle, the \"lacquer calligraphy\" (Qi shu 漆书) is very well-known. The poet explicitely referred to bamboo in the first line (五代隃糜内库纸，开轩画竹云舒舒) of the poem."@en ;

    ns3:description """Artist from Chengdu, also active in Paris since 2008, Pang Fan 庞凡 – better known as Fan Sack – began his activity as a writer in 2003, at the age of fifteen. At the start of his career, Fan Sack started “bombing” the streets of Chengdu with his tag and experimented with various forms of writing, from simple tagging-up to the creation of more complex pieces. 
Fan Sack is a famous artist of international repute; he has his own studio and often shows his works in exhibitions and galleries. Nevertheless, he often comes back to Chengdu to participate in events and festivals, especially involving young people, to contribute to the promotion of the hip-hop culture and spread the graffiti movement in China. 
Throughout his career, Fan Sack has explored different forms of art, such as graffiti writing, street art and painting, creating artworks permeated with Buddhist influences. The artist’s predilection is to make his creations outdoors, on the street, even though Fan Sack may be identified more as a street artist than a simple "graffiti artist". 
Fan Sack is a complex and multifaceted artist. He is perhaps one of the few – among the many Chinese colleagues who started out like him – to have embarked on a fruitful career in continuous evolution and on an international scale. """@en ;

Through meticulous techniques, such as reproducing texts from Confucian classics only to dissolve them into sculptures of paper pulps, Chen explores themes of cultural transformation and loss, and he offers a unique perspective on a culture he believes is eroding. Central to his work is the recognition of calligraphy as a performance art, with each brushstroke embodying the calligrapher's gestures and intentions. Chen's minimalist compositions blend tradition with modernity, inviting viewers to contemplate the intricate balance between past and present in contemporary Chinese art."@en ;

    dcterms:description """The crew was founded on a blog in 2007 by Jin Ye (Hu(r)ri, Read or Hali), Reign (or Lame), Snow and Tin.G. The birth of the OOPS crew on a blog demonstrates the importance of the Internet for Chinese writers, as the four members did not meet directly on the street. Actually, the crew has hosted other members over the years, including two European artists: Moon, Aekone (a.k.a. Aek, from Yangzhou), Redim, Kite (from Guangxi); and Diase (Italian writer) and Storm (French writer). This highlights how there are many foreign writers operating in China who actively collaborate with Chinese crews and writers, contaminating both themselves and each other.
The OOPS crew is the most famous and influential crew in Shanghai. It combines the Western graffiti art movement with the Chinese artistic and cultural tradition, using characters, calligraphy and ancient Chinese symbols, and represents the cosmopolitan / transcultural and transnational trends in Shanghai. In terms of style, the OOPS crew’s pieces refer to the Euro-American tradition, using, specifically, wildstyle with 3D effects, often enriched by a background or figurative elements from the Chinese painting tradition.
"The crew cultivates varying perceptions and self-identities in their work, but they are as a whole known for their elaborate pieces combining alphabets, Chinese writing and characters. Currently, many of the local members are occupied by their everyday work and seldom have time to paint" (Valjakka 2016, 363).
One of the most important members of the crew is Tin.G, the only female writer of the crew. She is one of the most acclaimed female writers in the country, who represents the new post-graffiti trend through the adhesion to hip hop culture, visual propaganda of her stickers, evolution of her puppets in open-air illustrations. While not using characters, Tin.G includes elements of Chinese culture in her pieces."""@en ;

As it is usual in Chinese calligraphic work, they are written vertically (from top to bottom). In the two big characters, the variation of the width of the strokes produced by a skillful use of the spray-painting is a contemporary expedient to create the illusion of being in front of a classical calligraphy written with the ink brush. 
The name of the crew is significant because it clearly reveals the deep meaning of their art: ‘Kwan-yin’ explicitly refers to the ‘Bodhisattva Guanyin’ (Guanyin Pusa 观音菩萨), one of the most popular and well known deity in China. The crew itself points out that the story of the Bodhisattva was fundamental for the choice of their name: Guanyin, in fact, was introduced into China via the Silk Road and was initially presented in a male form, but when Buddhism rooted in China, the Bodhisattva was sinicized and subsequently transformed into a Chinese female form, which later became extremely popular all over the country. Kwanyin Clan’s artistic aim is to present graffiti art in China as an alter ego of the Bodhisattva Guanyin: as it had happened for Guanyin, graffiti art came from abroad, but if it wants to become popular in China it has to sinicize its forms, undergoing deity own metamorphosis."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Writing Diary with Water Series / Water Diary Series (水写日记系列)" ;
    ns3:description """In this series, Song Dong uses a brush dipped in water to write a sort of invisible diary. 
Evaporating brushstrokes are methodically painted one on the top of the other, over and over again, on the same impassive surface. The text appears momentarily before vanishing and being replaced by the next fluid characters. Song Dong refers to these performances as an ongoing "private and personal event", a description that points to the essence of much of his practise. The artist sets aside time each day to think about life and living, and to let such thoughts dissolve through the water that flows from his brush. The contemplative nature of this process transforms it into an act of meditation. His intent as an artist is fundamentally iconoclastic: to disrupt categories, media hierarchies and bureaucratic as well as aesthetic expectations. And yet these "political" goals are achieved more often than not through works of art that are uncommonly intimate. Diaries serve a number of purposes, from keeping track of appointments to the documentation of events over time. They can be used to trigger memories or to reflect on ideas, emotions and reactions. The defining character of a diary, however, must surely be its self-confessional and innately private nature: diaries contain information relating to an individual, information that is written down rather than shared. Nevertheless with conventional diarising there is an inherent chance of disclosure: the awareness that other people may at some time read what is initially written in secret. """@en ;

"Writing Time with Water" is a compelling example of Song Dongs interest in context and ritual. These performances stem from the artist's series "Writing Diary with Water". 
The series took place in different cities of the world: Beijing (1995), London (2000), Sidney (2002), Brisbane (2002-2003), New York (2005), and Chambelltown (2010).

    ns3:description """The Chinese characters on Zhang Huan's body are written by some of his friends during the performance entitled "1/2". Some of the characters are simplified characters and some orthers are traditional ones. The style of the characters recalls regular and running scripts. 
There are some characters that often recur, for example xin 心 ('heart') and ren 人 ('person'). The character xin can refer to either one's "heart" and "mind". Literally, xin (心) refers to the physical heart, though it also refers to the "mind" as the ancient Chinese believed the heart was the center of human cognition. However, emotion and reason were not considered as separate, but rather as coextensive; xin is as much cognitive as emotional, being simultaneously associated with thought and feeling. For these reasons, it is also often translated as "heart-mind". In this case, the use of the character xin 心 ('heart') is particularly significant because it represents the mind/heart unit that has been separated during the performance. The use of the character ren 人 is also significant because it remarks that the individual/person is divided between body and mind. The characters xin 心 and ren 人 seem to chase each other on the artist's body, without ever being reunited.
Other important words visible on Zhang Huan's forehead are Fo 佛 (Buddha) and  guan 覌 (sight, view, appaerance, to look at, to observe). The character Fo 佛 is transcribed in correspondence of the brain (on the arstist's head) and it recalls the importance that the mind and meditation have for Buddhism and for the Buddhist vision of life. The character guan 覌  is written between the artist's eyes because for Buddhism the real eyes are represented precisely by the mind.
In addition to Chinese characters, there are also Latin letters ("A, B, C" on the right arm of the artist) and punctuation marks (e.g. two question marks on his breast). """@en ;

    ns3:description """This series consists of big panels in which Chinese characters are written backwards, overturned, crossed out, mutilated or reconstructed. These characters have been taken away from their original function to play a syntactical part in a sentence. They are detached, synthesized, misplaced, overlapped, miswritten, negated and inverted to create an uncertain world.   
In many cases, Gu's paintings are pure imagery of Chinese written characters. 
In this series, Gu Wenda re-elaborates and deconstructs not only traditional calligraphy and but also traditional landscape ink painting. Instead of mountains, clouds, trees and streams, in fact,  abstract and semi-abstract ink marks float across the page along with similarly abstract, pseudo-Chinese characters. Bessire affirms that: " Gu's audacious explorations, his new techniques, his elimination of individual brush stroke and unreadable Chinese characters, have allowed him to create a new kind of Chinese ink painting: conceptualized abstract ink painting."
The series is composed of several works, each one exploring different compositions of characters . The most important works are: "Wo piyue san nan san nu de jing zi 我批阅三男三女书写的静字"(Characters of "Still" Written by Three Men and Three Woman), "Zhengfan de zi 正反的字" (Negative and Positive Characters), "Cuowei de zi 错位的字" (Misplaced Characters), "Wuyi de zi 无意的字" (Meaningless Characters) and "Tuteng yu jinji 图腾与禁忌" (Modern Meaning of Totem and Taboos). Also works from "The Mythos of Last Dinasties" became part of this series (e.g. "Synthesized Words” 1985). """@en ;

    ns3:description """In this performance, Qiu Zhijie decides to devote himself  to copying the work "Lanting xu 兰亭序" (Orchid Pavilion Preface) composed by Wang Xizhi in 353 AD. Qiu Zhijie repeatedly copies the work a thousand times on the same piece of rice papersheet. Repeatedly writing over his free-hand interpretation of the original, Qiu turns the paper into a saturated black field. By focusing on the process of writing rather than on its literary content, Qiu asserts that the ultimate goal of calligraphic practice is a form of "written meditation".
By continuing to overwrite, even once the surface is completely blackened, Qiu Zhijie arrives at the total annihilation of the work, its non-existence. In this way, Qiu underlines how the work can not be viewed, like a tangible document, but it resides only in the memory and imagination of individuals who have handed it down. Calligraphy becomes a metaphor for social orthodoxy and cultural reproduction, reducing culture to a mere mechanical practice, in which there is no possibility of criticism and renewal.
Qiu Zhijie also carries out a very similar operation in another performance entitled "Heart Sutra" (Xin jing 心 经, 1999), copying the ancient Buddhist text of the Heart Sutra. In this performance, Qiu Zhijie copies the work hundred times until the page is completely obscured. Here the artist wonders about the veracity and reliability of a translated text (from Sanskrit) like the Chinese Heart Sutra that represents a fundamental text for the spread of Chan Buddhism in China.

The year of the Yin Water Ox,
At the beginning of the third lunar month,
We are all gathered at the orchid pavilion in Shanyin County, Guiji Commandery,
For the Spring Purification Festival.
All of the prominent people have arrived,
From old to young.
This is an area of high mountains and lofty peaks,
With an exuberant growth of trees and bamboos,
It also has clear rushing water,
Reflecting the sunlight as it flows past either side of the pavilion.
The guests are seated side by side to play the drinking game where a wine cup is floated down the stream and the first person sitting in front of the cup when it stops must drink.
Although we lack the boisterousness of a live orchestra,
With a cup of wine here and a reciting of poetry there, it is sufficient to allow for a pleasant exchange of cordial conversations.
Today, the sky is bright and the air is clear,
With a gentle breeze that is blowing freely. When looking up, one can see the vastness of the heavens,
And when looking down, one can observe the abundance of things. The contentment of allowing one’s eyes to wander,
Is enough to reach the heights of delight for the sight and sound. What a joy.
Now all people live in this world together,
Some will take all of their aspirations, and share them in private with a friend;
Still others will abandon themselves to reckless pursuits.
Even though everyone makes different choices in life, some thoughtful and some rash,
When a person meets with joy, he will temporarily be pleased,
And will feel content, but he is not mindful that old age will soon overtake him.
Wait until that person becomes weary, or has a change of heart about something,
And will thus be filled with regrets.
The happiness of the past, in the blink of an eye,
Will have already become a distant memory, and this cannot but cause one to sigh;
In any case, the length of a man’s life is determined by the Creator, and we will all turn to dust in the end.
The ancients have said, "Birth and Death are both momentous occasions."
Isn’t that sad!
Every time I consider the reasons for why the people of old had regrets,
I am always moved to sadness by their writings,
And I can not explain why I am saddened.
I most certainly know that it is false and absurd to treat life and death as one and the same,
And it is equally absurd to think of dying at an old age as being the same as dying at a young age.
When future generations look back to my time, it will probably be similar to how I now think of the past.
What a shame! Therefore, when I list out the people that were here,
And record their musings, even though times and circumstances will change,
As for the things that we regret, they are the same.
For the people who read this in future generations, perhaps you will likewise be moved by these words."""@en,

古人云﹕「死生亦大矣。」
豈不痛哉！
每攬昔人興感之由，
若合一契，未嘗不臨文嗟悼，
不能喻之于懷。
固知一死生為虛誕，
齊彭殤為妄作。
後之視今，亦由今之視昔。
悲夫！故列敘時人，
錄其所述，雖世殊事異，
所以興懷，其致一也。
後之攬者，亦將有感於斯文。"""@zh ;

    ns3:description """This Calli-Writing Unit is the first inscription in the centre of the scroll. It is written in "big characters" (dazi 大字) and in regular script (kaishu 楷书). The first calligraphy is composed of only two traditional Chinese characters, Guan Yin 觀音, the Chinese name of the crew. As it is usual in Chinese calligraphic work, they are written vertically (from top to bottom).
In the two big characters, the variation of the width of the strokes produced by a skillful use of the spray-painting is a contemporary expedient to create the illusion of being in front of a classical calligraphy written with the ink brush. Furthermore, if we look at the arrangement of this written section, we will notice that it also reproduces a traditional calligraphic pattern: the main text (the two big characters) is in the center of the work, occupying a commanding position, while the inscriptions with the name of the artists are written on the sides in smaller size (even if horizontally and in alphabetic letters).
The name of the crew is significant because it clearly reveals the deep meaning of their art: ‘Kwan-yin’ explicitly refers to the ‘Bodhisattva Guanyin’ (Guanyin Pusa 观音菩萨), one of the most popular and well known deity in China. The crew itself points out that the story of the Bodhisattva was fundamental for the choice of their name: Guanyin, in fact, was introduced into China via the Silk Road and was initially presented in a male form, but when Buddhism rooted in China, the Bodhisattva was sinicized and subsequently transformed into a Chinese female form, which later became extremely popular all over the country. Kwanyin Clan’s artistic aim is to present graffiti art in China as an alter ego of the Bodhisattva Guanyin: as it had happened for Guanyin, graffiti art came from abroad, but if it wants to become popular in China it has to sinicize its forms, undergoing deity own metamorphosis."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Free Cloud Calligraphy Series (云自在书系列)" ;
    ns3:description """This series goes from June 6, 2020 to May 29, 2021. It initially takes place inside the studios. In a second phase, the performances are made public during some exhibitions in Hangzhou and Shanghai and in some open spaces (beaches and other natural spaces). 
Zhang Qiang creates the so-called "Blinded Calligraphy" (mang shu 盲书): looking away, the artist holds up an ink-soaked brush, creating traces of ink while the female counterpart Ding Feifei 丁斐斐 moves a sheet of paper or silk over his head, as if to simulate the movement of clouds in the sky. However, as Ding Feifei points out, Yunshu 云书 is a work that Ding Feifei conceived and created together with Zhang Qiang, while Mang shu 盲书 is a work that Zhang Qiang conceived independently, inviting women to work with him. In fact, all materials and techniques used are chosen by Ding Feifei, who thus becomes a full-fledged collaborator and creator of the experimentation.
The performances have a duration that varies from 10 minutes to half an hour (excluding the preparatory work). During the performances inside the studios, relaxing background music is usually played. The music consists on various tracks collected in NetEase Cloud Music (Wangyi yun yinyue 网易云音乐), a freemium music streaming service famous in China. From these performances a total of 100 works on paper or silk are created.

    ns3:description """This series by Zhang Qiang runs from 2018 to 2022. In these four years, Zhang Qiang participates in three different exhibitions that took place at the "Sanbao Ceramic Art Base" of Jingdezhen (景德镇三宝蓬艺术聚落) giving life to calligraphic performances. The female counterpart is holding and rotating some ceramic objects (of different shapes and sizes) while Zhang Qiang, looking away, writes on the objects with a particular glaze used to decorate ceramics, leaving traces on them. During the performance, the female counterpart freely chooses background music from her mobile phone. At the end of the performance, the ceramics are donated to the sponsors and organizers of the exhibition, while the remaining part is added to Zhang Qiang's private collection. On the ceramics there is often a "red sign", representing the two characters of the name of the female counterpart. 
The first exhibition takes place in October 27, 2018, the second from 19 to 29 January, 2019 and the third in June, 2022.
In 2018, Zhang Qiang did three performances, collaborating with three different female counterparts: 1) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/J 1 (Zhan Yuanyuan) Model [张强踪迹学报告A/J 1 (詹苑源)]; 2) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/J 2 (Ren Yixin) Model [张强踪迹学报告 A/J 2 (任一心) 模型]; 3) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report (Xie Xueke) Model [张强踪迹学报告 A/J 3 (谢雪珂) 模型].
In the 2019 Exhibition Zhang Qiang did five performances: 1) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/J 4 (Gu Yun) Model [张强踪迹学报告 A/J 4 (顾韵) 模型]; 2) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/J 5  (Zhang Qingzhi) Model [张强踪迹学报告 A/J 5(张青枝) 模型]; 3) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/J 6 (Guan Wenru) Model [张强踪迹学报告 A/J 6 (关文茹) 模型 ]; 4) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/J 7 (Gao Ya) Model [张强踪迹学报告A/J 7 (高雅) 模型 ]; 5) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/J 8 (Jane Yijing) Model [张强踪迹学报告A/J 8 (简怡静) 模型 ].
In 2022, Zhang Qiang did other three performances: 1) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/J 9 (Wang Lina) Model [张强踪迹学报告 A/J 9 (王丽娜) 模型]; 2) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/J 10 (Zhou Wenqian) Model [张强踪迹学报告 A/J 10 (周文倩) 模型]; 3) Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/J 11 (Gu Tiantian) Model [张强踪迹学报告A/J 11 (郭天天) 模型].

    ns2:title "Uterus Series (子宫系列)" ;
    ns3:description """The "Uterus Series" (Zigong xilie 子宫系列) takes place between 2021 and 2022. The series is a performative action composed of different performances that use calligraphy as a means of expression. Each performance tells a different female story: Wu Xixia writes Chinese characters while she is inside a hermetic transparent plastic sphere that symbolizes the mother's womb. As the performance progresses, the amount of oxygen is gradually depleted, until the sphere fills only with carbon dioxide. At that point, the artist requests that the sphere be broken before suffocating. The nightgown and bruises on her body, represent the state of domestic violence that women have been subjected to for thousands of years by men. “Writing” is an important symbol for this series and the use of different styles and brushes has specific meanings. 
Before this series, the artist experiments with different media to explore the issue of gender. At first, the artist wraps her body and women objects with plastic film to express the concept of "suffocation" [e.g. “Plastic Women Series" (Su nu xilie 塑女系列) 2015-2018] then in 2021 she started using hermetic spheres during her performances, such as:
1) "Writing the Orchid Pavilion One Time" (Shuxie Lanting Xu yi bian 书写兰亭序一遍, 2021) in which calligraphy becomes an important symbol of the patriarchy. In this performance, the famous twenty different forms of zhi 之 character present in the original "Orchid Pavilion Preface" by Wang Xizhi are replaced by Wu Xixia with red images of male phalluses. The zhi 之 character, that is one of the most important in Chinese masculine calligraphic tradition, is used by Wu Xixia as a symbol of order and authority (quanwei 权威). The nightgown worn by the artist and the bruises all over her body also represent the state of domestic violence suffered by women from men in history. This performance is defined by the artist as a "non-literary" work (fei wenxue xing 非文学性) and aims to shake the consciences of people who take part in it. During the writing process, the oxygen inside the sphere is gradually depleted, infusing it with carbon dioxide. Just before suffocating, the artist will ask for help to get out of the sphere. Wu Xixia calls this type of performance “a self-redemption with the aim of suffocating” (yi chang yi zhixi wei mudi de zi wo jiushu 一场以窒息为目的的自我救赎).
2) "Writing the Orchid Pavilion for the Second Time" (Shuxie Lanting Xu di er bian 书写兰亭序第二遍, 2022) in which calligraphy again becomes a patriarchal symbol. Previously, on the inflatable outer part of the perimeter surrounding the sphere, ideomatic phrases were written such as: "chi bao cheng 吃饱撑" (having nothing better to do); "xingwei yishu 行为艺术" (performance art); "huazhong quchong 哗众取宠" (try to please the public with claptrap), etc. In this case, Wu Xixia writes inside an airtight sphere placed in the water and the character "ye 也" is replaced with the image of female vagina. Characters within the sphere are written predominantly in red ink. Wu Xixia also writes some larger characters in "nüshu 女书" (women's script), a syllabic script derived from Chinese characters that was used exclusively among women in Jiangyong County in Hunan province of southern China. Using this characters' form, she wants to counterbalance the male predominance of Chinese writing with the female writing of nüshu 女书. 
3) "I" (Wo 我, 2021) in which Wu Xixia carries out a reflection on women and herself, writing the labels of society’s goodwill and malice towards women in red paint, such as "whore" (biao zi 婊子) "old maid" (lao chunu 老处女), "good wife and loving mother" (xian qiliang mu 贤妻良母), "green tea bitch (luchabiao 绿茶婊), "teenage girl" (yunu 玉女), "white lotus" (bailian hua 白莲花), etc. Through this performance, she wants to answer questions such as: "Who are women? And who am I? Is my gender determined by birth or is it given by society? There is a womb here, but where is the "mother"?". Having been rejected by her family at the time of her birth as a female, she has been questioning her gender throughout her formative years, and the social labels she writes about are an attempt to reconcile herself with her gender identity.
4) "Darling" (2021) in which Wu Xixia performs in front of a building called "Darling". The building was covered with red ribbons, which spread all the way to the inflatable ball. Wu Xixia writes the words "jiu jiu wo 救救我" (help me); "qiuqiu ni 求求你" (I beg you), "bie sha wo 别杀我" (don't kill me); "bie S wo  别S我" (don't fuck me), etc. inside the hermetic sphere. The female body becomes an object of desire and "objectification" under the male gaze. In the process of doing performance art, passers-by, especially men, took photos with various poses and angles nearby. In the course of more than 40 minutes, the artist lay quietly on the ground to receive everyone’s gaze, to begin to write down the words for help. Red gives a signal of judgment, and the red ribbon is the concretization of the female body being stared at. The building covered with red ribbons symbolize the existing and massive examination of the female body. The artist wraps the red ribbon of the building on the inflatable ball, representing the current situation of women who are looking at fearlessly and pursuing physical freedom, but it is still difficult to escape from the scrutiny. In the past, the female body has always been hidden. Nowadays, with the awakening of female consciousness, women break free from the shackles and turn from invisibility to openness and fearless publicity. In this transition, the female body is no longer a private and invisible object, but exposed to the public eye. Just as the protagonist of this performance art puts herself under public scrutiny, it is a challenge, but cannot escape scrutiny. This performance aims to arouse people's attention to the predicament of women breaking free from physical examination (wuwei shenshi 无畏审视).
5) "Right" (Zhengque 正确, 2021) where Wu Xixia invites the audience to write what they think is "right" outside the ball, while the artist repeatedly writes inside the ball the two characters "zhengque 正确" using the "large character calligraphy style" (da zi shuti 大字书体) until she is completely "enveloped" by the two characters. In this work, the acrylic paints and characters that read "Please write down what you think is right" on the ground attracted the attention of many viewers. Audiences of different ages and genders wrote words such as "justice" (zhengyi 正义)  and "love" (ai 爱) on the outside of a transparent airtight ball, and the artist inside the ball repeatedly wrote the word "correct" with red paint. The use of the large character calligraphy style also implies the existence of authority. The artist wants to focus on presenting the "gender troubles" in contemporary society. "How to define what is right?" and "Who defines what is right?" become the explicit themes of the performance, and the artist's gaze and being stared at become the invisible themes behind it.
6) "Letter to Mom" (Yu mu shu 与母书, 2022) in which Wu Xixia interacts with twenty children. Before starting the performance, the artist guides the children to think and create characters or drawings, randomly combining images relating to figures or names that recall moments with their mother. The aim is to create a language that belongs only to the children and their mothers, and then write it outside the sphere. At the same time, Wu Xixia writes the Chinese character "ma 妈" (mother) inside the sphere in the traditional form.
Some of these spheres then became part of the installation exposed in Beijing in 2021 in occasion of the "Xixia Wu Personal Art Exhibition" (Wu Xixia ge zhan 吴析夏个展 - December 6 to 20, 2021) called "Her Mountain" (Ta shan 她山, see the archive). In this installation, Wu Xixia creates a "mountain of blood" full of symbols linked to childbirth and the female womb (such as some foetuses lying in red wedges) to talk about gender issues in contemporary society. The form of the entire installation is combined with the Da Henggin Mountain 大横琴山 and Xiao Hengqin Mountain 小横琴山 visible behind the glass windows (two mountain ranges of Hengqin Island, in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province) visible behind the glass windows. Just as gravel collects in a mountain range, women form a "group". The red-flecked stainless steel flowers blooming on "Her-Mountain" represent the "blossoming" of spiritual consciousness. In the installation, there are also the three closed spheres resulting from the three feminist-themed performative works realized by Wu Xixia: "I" (Wo 我) a work that reconciles personal identity and gender; "Darling", a work on the fearless examination of women (of this work there is also a screen with the photo/video of the performance in progress); and "Writing the Orchid Pavilion Preface One time" (Shuxie Lanting Xu yi bian 书写兰亭序一遍) which attempts to break the traditional rules of Chinese calligraphy. The three independent spheres and the surrounding red mountains, that represent respectively the "individuals" and the "groups", complement each other, presenting a utopia in which the "self" (inner world) and the whole (external world) "bloom" in the process of awakening the female consciousness."""@en ;

    ns3:description """This artwork is created during the performance "Writing the Orchid Pavilion Preface One Time (Shuxie Lanting Xu yibian 书写兰亭序一遍)" held in Macau in 2021.  It is an airtight plastic sphere on which Wu Xixia writes inside the “Orchid Pavilion Preface” composed by Wang Xizhi 王羲之 (303–361) in 353. During the writing process, the different forms of the twenty zhi 之 characters present in the poem, which have always been praised and imitated by all Chinese calligraphers, were replaced with visible red ink male phalluses. The character zhi 之, as a symbol of order, represents the "authority" (quanwei 权威).
This artwork then became part of the installation held in Beijing in 2021 called "Her Mountain" (Ta shan 她山) in which Wu Xixia creates a "mountain of blood" full of symbols linked to childbirth and the female womb (such as some foetuses lying in red wedges) to talk about gender issues in contemporary society."""@en ;

    ns3:trascription-or-translation """It is the ninth year of Emperor Mu of Jin's Yonghe era
The year of the Yin Water Ox,
At the beginning of the third lunar month,
We are all gathered at the orchid pavilion in Shanyin County, Guiji Commandery,
For the Spring Purification Festival.
All of the prominent people have arrived,
From old to young.
This is an area of high mountains and lofty peaks,
With an exuberant growth of trees and bamboos,
It also has clear rushing water,
Reflecting the sunlight as it flows past either side of the pavilion.
The guests are seated side by side to play the drinking game where a wine cup is floated down the stream and the first person sitting in front of the cup when it stops must drink.
Although we lack the boisterousness of a live orchestra,
With a cup of wine here and a reciting of poetry there, it is sufficient to allow for a pleasant exchange of cordial conversations.
Today, the sky is bright and the air is clear,
With a gentle breeze that is blowing freely. When looking up, one can see the vastness of the heavens,
And when looking down, one can observe the abundance of things. The contentment of allowing one’s eyes to wander,
Is enough to reach the heights of delight for the sight and sound. What a joy.
Now all people live in this world together,
Some will take all of their aspirations, and share them in private with a friend;
Still others will abandon themselves to reckless pursuits.
Even though everyone makes different choices in life, some thoughtful and some rash,
When a person meets with joy, he will temporarily be pleased,
And will feel content, but he is not mindful that old age will soon overtake him.
Wait until that person becomes weary, or has a change of heart about something,
And will thus be filled with regrets.
The happiness of the past, in the blink of an eye,
Will have already become a distant memory, and this cannot but cause one to sigh;
In any case, the length of a man’s life is determined by the Creator, and we will all turn to dust in the end.
The ancients have said, "Birth and Death are both momentous occasions."
Isn’t that sad!
Every time I consider the reasons for why the people of old had regrets,
I am always moved to sadness by their writings,
And I can not explain why I am saddened.
I most certainly know that it is false and absurd to treat life and death as one and the same,
And it is equally absurd to think of dying at an old age as being the same as dying at a young age.
When future generations look back to my time, it will probably be similar to how I now think of the past.
What a shame! Therefore, when I list out the people that were here,
And record their musings, even though times and circumstances will change,
As for the things that we regret, they are the same.
For the people who read this in future generations, perhaps you will likewise be moved by these words."""@en,

She obtained her master’s degree in Chinese Language and Culture cum laude from Sapienza University of Rome (2009), where she also earned her Ph.D. in Asian and African Civilizations, Cultures and Societies (2014).
Her research activity focuses on Chinese contemporary calligraphy, with particular attention to the analysis of the main artistic expressions that deviate from traditional calligraphic forms (e.g. graffiti art). The main aim of her research is to provide a model for qualitative analysis of these new artistic expressions, proposing a new taxonomy of Chinese renewed calligraphy production, a systematic study on its language and texts, and revealing socio-political and economic implications of their emergence.
She has authored 3 books in Chinese that received the highest academic award for Chinese National Books (one of them also received the bronze medal for Chinese Art Book 2019) and several academic articles, book chapters, and translations. She has also been the curator of international Chinese art exhibitions in Italy and abroad, that involved hundreds of artists from all over the world, and she has many active collaborations with museums and galleries in Italy and in China. She has been a visiting researcher at Liaoning Normal University and China Academy of Art. She is a member of the scientific committee of the Asia Institute  and of the Xiyuan yaji journal (specialized in Chinese contemporary art and calligraphy). She is a member of the Italian Association of Chinese Studies (AISC), European Association for Chinese Studies (EACS), and European Association for Asian Art and Archeology (EAAA).
From 2020, she is the Principal Investigator of a Research Project entitled "WRITE: New Forms of Calligraphy in China: A Contemporary Culture Mirror" (GA n. 949645)."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Luo Qi: Writing Music (洛齐 : 写乐)" ;
    ns3:description "\"Luo Qi: Writing Music\" is an exhibition that opens the viewer up with the possibility of embarking on a journey to discover the ancient and fascinating art of Chinese calligraphy and its intimate link with music. For the first time, the works of one of the most important living Chinese calligraphers, master Luo Qi (Hangzhou, 1960), professor of calligraphy at the China Academy of Art, the most renowned art academy in China, are exhibited in the city of Bologna. Within the exhibition, the artist presents five series of calligraphic-musical works in the form of album sheets and long panels that cover the entire room of the Aula Magna of the University Library in an enveloping and engaging melody of signs . The main series, entitled Musical Calligraphies – Silent Melodies, is a set of rolls in which the artist, taking his cue from famous Italian songs such as “'O sole mio” and “Volare” and from opera arias such as “Rigoletto” and \"La traviata\" translates these melodies into a concatenation of calligraphic signs inspired by the most ancient Chinese musical notation system, dating back to the 10th century and made up of ancient characters, with strong references to abstract art and western naive art. In these original \"Ink Symphonies\", Luo Qi therefore manages to represent the harmonious encounter between East and West, conversing in a dedicated space \"resonant with culture\" such as the University Library of Bologna. The exhibition is curated by Adriana Iezzi and is organized by the University Library of Bologna and the Department of Interpretation and Translation of the University of Bologna, in collaboration with the Collegium Musicum Almae Matris."@en ;

    ns2:title "Department of Interpretation and Translation (DIT)" ;
    ns3:description """The Department of Interpreting and Translation (DIT) was born in October 2012, taking on the legacy of the former SITLeC Department and the former Advanced School of Modern Languages ​​for Interpreters and Translators (SSLMIT).
The DIT places strong emphasis on research applied to the theoretical, practical and educational aspects of translation and interpreting, also with the support of new technologies, as well as on literary, genre and historical studies. The research strategies are therefore closely linked to the didactic and third mission aspects. This interaction and mutual valorisation have been considered fundamental characteristics for the Department since its creation.
From the point of view of teaching, the DIT offers a first level degree course and two master's degree courses , all with limited enrollment, and is home to a research doctorate . It has over 10 equipped laboratories, both for teaching simultaneous interpretation and assisted and multimedia translation. The quality of the educational offer is demonstrated by the excellent attractiveness , with an average percentage of students registered for the selection tests between 300% and 650% of the available places.
The DIT and its study programs are accredited by the most prestigious international networks , including the worldwide network of university institutions for the training of interpreters and translators (CIUTI), the European Master's in Translation (EMT) network, the International Master's in Conference Interpreting (EMCI) network and the International Doctorate in Translation Studies (ID-TS) network.
Finally, on the third mission front, the Department has a strong vocation for continuous training and open teaching, in which it invests its skills. In particular, skills in translation, terminology and language technologies are at the center of numerous Lifelong learning events and targeted internships with companies. The teaching skills of language 1 and 2 are instead the subject of meetings with school teachers. The DIT also shows a marked interest in consolidating relationships with local stakeholders , in particular through projects and collaborations that make it possible to disseminate knowledge to the public in areas such astheater and audio description, children's literature and gender issues and issues related to translation and mediation by girls and boys who are children of migrants."""@en ;

The year of the Yin Water Ox,
At the beginning of the third lunar month,
We are all gathered at the orchid pavilion in Shanyin County, Guiji Commandery,
For the Spring Purification Festival.
All of the prominent people have arrived,
From old to young.
This is an area of high mountains and lofty peaks,
With an exuberant growth of trees and bamboos,
It also has clear rushing water,
Reflecting the sunlight as it flows past either side of the pavilion.
The guests are seated side by side to play the drinking game where a wine cup is floated down the stream and the first person sitting in front of the cup when it stops must drink.
Although we lack the boisterousness of a live orchestra,
With a cup of wine here and a reciting of poetry there, it is sufficient to allow for a pleasant exchange of cordial conversations.
Today, the sky is bright and the air is clear,
With a gentle breeze that is blowing freely. When looking up, one can see the vastness of the heavens,
And when looking down, one can observe the abundance of things. The contentment of allowing one’s eyes to wander,
Is enough to reach the heights of delight for the sight and sound. What a joy.
Now all people live in this world together,
Some will take all of their aspirations, and share them in private with a friend;
Still others will abandon themselves to reckless pursuits.
Even though everyone makes different choices in life, some thoughtful and some rash,
When a person meets with joy, he will temporarily be pleased,
And will feel content, but he is not mindful that old age will soon overtake him.
Wait until that person becomes weary, or has a change of heart about something,
And will thus be filled with regrets.
The happiness of the past, in the blink of an eye,
Will have already become a distant memory, and this cannot but cause one to sigh;
In any case, the length of a man’s life is determined by the Creator, and we will all turn to dust in the end.
The ancients have said, "Birth and Death are both momentous occasions."
Isn’t that sad!
Every time I consider the reasons for why the people of old had regrets,
I am always moved to sadness by their writings,
And I can not explain why I am saddened.
I most certainly know that it is false and absurd to treat life and death as one and the same,
And it is equally absurd to think of dying at an old age as being the same as dying at a young age.
When future generations look back to my time, it will probably be similar to how I now think of the past.
What a shame! Therefore, when I list out the people that were here,
And record their musings, even though times and circumstances will change,
As for the things that we regret, they are the same.
For the people who read this in future generations, perhaps you will likewise be moved by these words."""@en,

    ns3:description """This CWU is part of the artwork realized by Li Xinmo during the performance "Landscape Painting Painted in Water (画在水中的山水)". It consists of the four characters "Qianli jiangshan 千里江山" (One Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains) written with red vermillion ink in traditional form. These characters are inspired by a long scroll of blue and green landscapes painted by Wang Ximeng 王希孟 (1096 – 1119) a painter of the Song Dynasty entitled: “One Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" (Qianli jianshan tu千里洪山圖) , a very famous landscape painting which depicts the wonderful landscape of China. The stark contrast of the red ink on green algae slowly dissipates into the pond’s water, rendering the characters illegible.

This painting is probably the finest example of Chinese blue-green landscape painting. It is the only surviving piece by the young genius Wang Ximeng, who painted it under Emperor Huizong’s guidance when he was 18 years old. Little is known about Wang Ximeng himself. It is said that he passed away probably around the age of 20. 
The entire piece, painted in the hand scroll format, deployed scattered perspectives and the three visual angles (height, depth, level-distance), which are commonly used in Chinese landscape paintings. When viewing this piece, the viewer’s line of sight is directed along the contours of the mountains and rivers with a panoramic view of thousands of miles across. This painting uses scarce mineral pigments with bright colors to depict the peaceful and prosperous country. In ancient Chinese landscape paintings, especially court paintings, the natural landscape is often a metaphor for the Emperor’s longevity and the dynasty’s everlasting prosperity. "One Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains", as its name implies, depicts the vast country landscape. It is the ideal world with perfect order and harmony according to the Emperor’s will, and it is also the Daoist fairyland in the heart of the Daoist Emperor Huizong."""@en ;

        "Set of signs (illegible)" ;
    ns3:trascription-or-translation """In the Northern Ocean there is a fish, the name of which is Kun - I do not know how many li in size. It changes into a bird with the name of Peng, the back of which is (also) - I do not know how many li in extent. When this bird rouses itself and flies, its wings are like clouds all round the sky. When the sea is moved (so as to bear it along), it prepares to remove to the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean is the Pool of Heaven.
There is the (book called) Qi Xie, a record of marvels. We have in it these words: 'When the peng is removing to the Southern Ocean it flaps (its wings) on the water for 3000 li. Then it ascends on a whirlwind 90,000 li, and it rests only at the end of six months.' (But similar to this is the movement of the breezes which we call) the horses of the fields, of the dust (which quivers in the sunbeams), and of living things as they are blown against one another by the air. Is its azure the proper colour of the sky? Or is it occasioned by its distance and illimitable extent? If one were looking down (from above), the very same appearance would just meet his view.
And moreover, (to speak of) the accumulation of water; if it be not great, it will not have strength to support a large boat. Upset a cup of water in a cavity, and a straw will float on it as if it were a boat. Place a cup in it, and it will stick fast; the water is shallow and the boat is large. (So it is with) the accumulation of wind; if it be not great, it will not have strength to support great wings. Therefore (the peng ascended to) the height of 90,000 li, and there was such a mass of wind beneath it; thenceforth the accumulation of wind was sufficient. As it seemed to bear the blue sky on its back, and there was nothing to obstruct or arrest its course, it could pursue its way to the South.
A cicada and a little dove laughed at it, saying, 'We make an effort and fly towards an elm or sapanwood tree; and sometimes before we reach it, we can do no more but drop to the ground. Of what use is it for this (creature) to rise 90,000 li, and make for the South?' He who goes to the grassy suburbs, returning to the third meal (of the day), will have his belly as full as when he set out; he who goes to a distance of 100 li will have to pound his grain where he stops for the night; he who goes a thousand li, will have to carry with him provisions for three months. What should these two small creatures know about the matter? The knowledge of that which is small does not reach to that which is great; (the experience of) a few years does not reach to that of many. How do we know that it is so? The mushroom of a morning does not know (what takes place between) the beginning and end of a month; the short-lived cicada does not know (what takes place between) the spring and autumn. These are instances of a short term of life. In the south of Chu there is the (tree) called Ming-ling, whose spring is 500 years, and its autumn the same; in high antiquity there was that called Da-chun, whose spring was 8000 years, and its autumn the same. And Peng Zu is the one man renowned to the present day for his length of life: if all men were (to wish) to match him, would they not be miserable?

n the questions put by Tang to Ji we have similar statements: 'In the bare and barren north there is the dark and vast ocean - the Pool of Heaven. In it there is a fish, several thousand li in breadth, while no one knows its length. Its name is the kun. There is (also) a bird named the peng; its back is like the Tai mountain, while its wings are like clouds all round the sky. On a whirlwind it mounts upwards as on the whorls of a goat's horn for 90,000 li, till, far removed from the cloudy vapours, it bears on its back the blue sky, and then it shapes its course for the South, and proceeds to the ocean there.' A quail by the side of a marsh laughed at it, and said, 'Where is it going to? I spring up with a bound, and come down again when I have reached but a few fathoms, and then fly about among the brushwood and bushes; and this is the perfection of flying. Where is that creature going to?' This shows the difference between the small and the great.

Thus it is that men, whose wisdom is sufficient for the duties of some one office, or whose conduct will secure harmony in some one district, or whose virtue is befitting a ruler so that they could efficiently govern some one state, are sure to look on themselves in this manner (like the quail), and yet Rongzi of Song would have smiled and laughed at them. (This Rongzi), though the whole world should have praised him, would not for that have stimulated himself to greater endeavour, and though the whole world should have condemned him, would not have exercised any more repression of his course; so fixed was he in the difference between the internal (judgment of himself) and the external (judgment of others), so distinctly had he marked out the bounding limit of glory and disgrace. Here, however, he stopped. His place in the world indeed had become indifferent to him, but still he had not planted himself firmly (in the right position). There was Liezi, who rode on the wind and pursued his way, with an admirable indifference (to all external things), returning, however, after fifteen days, (to his place). In regard to the things that (are supposed to) contribute to happiness, he was free from all endeavours to obtain them; but though he had not to walk, there was still something for which he had to wait. But suppose one who mounts on (the ether of) heaven and earth in its normal operation, and drives along the six elemental energies of the changing (seasons), thus enjoying himself in the illimitable - what has he to wait for? Therefore it is said, 'The Perfect man has no (thought of) self; the Spirit-like man, none of merit; the Sagely-minded man, none of fame.'

Yao, proposing to resign the throne to Xu You, said, 'When the sun and moon have come forth, if the torches have not been put out, would it not be difficult for them to give light? When the seasonal rains are coming down, if we still keep watering the ground, will not our toil be labour lost for all the good it will do? Do you, Master, stand forth (as sovereign), and the kingdom will (at once) be well governed. If I still (continue to) preside over it, I must look on myself as vainly occupying the place - I beg to resign the throne to you.' Xu You said, 'You, Sir, govern the kingdom, and the kingdom is well governed. If I in these circumstances take your place, shall I not be doing so for the sake of the name? But the name is but the guest of the reality; shall I be playing the part of the guest? The tailor-bird makes its nest in the deep forest, but only uses a single branch; the mole drinks from the He, but only takes what fills its belly. Return and rest in being ruler - I will have nothing to do with the throne. Though the cook were not attending to his kitchen, the representative of the dead and the officer of prayer would not leave their cups and stands to take his place.'

Jian Wu asked Lian Shu, saying, 'I heard Jie Yu talking words which were great, but had nothing corresponding to them (in reality); once gone, they could not be brought back. I was frightened by them; they were like the Milky Way which cannot be traced to its beginning or end. They had no connexion with one another, and were not akin to the experiences of men.' 'What were his words?' asked Lian Shu, and the other replied, (He said) that 'Far away on the hill of Gu Ye there dwelt a Spirit-like man whose flesh and skin were (smooth) as ice and (white) as snow; that his manner was elegant and delicate as that of a virgin; that he did not eat any of the five grains, but inhaled the wind and drank the dew; that he mounted on the clouds, drove along the flying dragons, rambling and enjoying himself beyond the four seas; that by the concentration of his spirit-like powers he could save men from disease and pestilence, and secure every year a plentiful harvest.' These words appeared to me wild and incoherent and I did not believe them. 'So it is,' said Lian Shu. 'The blind have no perception of the beauty of elegant figures, nor the deaf of the sound of bells and drums. But is it only the bodily senses of which deafness and blindness can be predicated? There is also a similar defect in the intelligence; and of this your words supply an illustration in yourself. That man, with those attributes, though all things were one mass of confusion, and he heard in that condition the whole world crying out to him to be rectified, would not have to address himself laboriously to the task, as if it were his business to rectify the world. Nothing could hurt that man; the greatest floods, reaching to the sky, could not drown him, nor would he feel the fervour of the greatest heats melting metals and stones till they flowed, and scorching all the ground and hills. From the dust and chaff of himself, he could still mould and fashion Yaos and Shuns - how should he be willing to occupy himself with things?' A man of Song, who dealt in the ceremonial caps (of Yin), went with them to Yue, the people of which cut off their hair and tattooed their bodies, so that they had no use for them. Yao ruled the people of the kingdom, and maintained a perfect government within the four seas. Having gone to see the four (Perfect) Ones on the distant hill of Gu Ye, when (he returned to his capital) on the south of the Fen water, his throne appeared no more to his deep-sunk oblivious eyes.

Huizi told Zhuangzi, saying, 'The king of Wei sent me some seeds of a large calabash, which I sowed. The fruit, when fully grown, could contain five piculs (of anything). I used it to contain water, but it was so heavy that I could not lift it by myself. I cut it in two to make the parts into drinking vessels; but the dried shells were too wide and unstable and would not hold (the liquor); nothing but large useless things! Because of their uselessness I knocked them to pieces.' Zhuangzi replied, 'You were indeed stupid, my master, in the use of what was large. There was a man of Song who was skilful at making a salve which kept the hands from getting chapped; and (his family) for generations had made the bleaching of cocoon-silk their business. A stranger heard of it, and proposed to buy the art of the preparation for a hundred ounces of silver. The kindred all came together, and considered the proposal. "We have," said they, "been bleaching cocoon-silk for generations, and have only gained a little money. Now in one morning we can sell to this man our art for a hundred ounces - let him have it." The stranger accordingly got it and went away with it to give counsel to the king of Wu, who was then engaged in hostilities with Yue. The king gave him the command of his fleet, and in the winter he had an engagement with that of Yue, on which he inflicted a great defeat, and was invested with a portion of territory taken from Yue. The keeping the hands from getting chapped was the same in both cases; but in the one case it led to the investiture (of the possessor of the salve), and in the other it had only enabled its owners to continue their bleaching. The difference of result was owing to the different use made of the art. Now you, Sir, had calabashes large enough to hold five piculs; why did you not think of making large bottle-gourds of them, by means of which you could have floated over rivers and lakes, instead of giving yourself the sorrow of finding that they were useless for holding anything. Your mind, my master, would seem to have been closed against all intelligence!'

Huizi said to Zhuangzi, 'I have a large tree, which men call the Ailantus. Its trunk swells out to a large size, but is not fit for a carpenter to apply his line to it; its smaller branches are knotted and crooked, so that the disk and square cannot be used on them. Though planted on the wayside, a builder would not turn his head to look at it. Now your words, Sir, are great, but of no use - all unite in putting them away from them.' Zhuangzi replied, 'Have you never seen a wildcat or a weasel? There it lies, crouching and low, till the wanderer approaches; east and west it leaps about, avoiding neither what is high nor what is low, till it is caught in a trap, or dies in a net. Again there is the Yak, so large that it is like a cloud hanging in the sky. It is large indeed, but it cannot catch mice. You, Sir, have a large tree and are troubled because it is of no use - why do you not plant it in a tract where there is nothing else, or in a wide and barren wild? There you might saunter idly by its side, or in the enjoyment of untroubled ease sleep beneath it. Neither bill nor axe would shorten its existence; there would be nothing to injure it. What is there in its uselessness to cause you distress?'"""@en,

湯之問棘也是已。窮髮之北，有冥海者，天池也。有魚焉，其廣數千里，未有知其脩者，其名為鯤。有鳥焉，其名為鵬，背若泰山，翼若垂天之雲，摶扶搖羊角而上者九萬里，絕雲氣，負青天，然後圖南，且適南冥也。斥鴳笑之曰：「彼且奚適也？我騰躍而上，不過數仞而下，翱翔蓬蒿之間，此亦飛之至也。而彼且奚適也？」此小大之辯也。


故夫知效一官，行比一鄉，德合一君而徵一國者，其自視也亦若此矣。而宋榮子猶然笑之。且舉世而譽之而不加勸，舉世而非之而不加沮，定乎內外之分，辯乎榮辱之竟，斯已矣。彼其於世，未數數然也。雖然，猶有未樹也。夫列子御風而行，泠然善也，旬有五日而後反。彼於致福者，未數數然也。此雖免乎行，猶有所待者也。若夫乘天地之正，而御六氣之辯，以遊無窮者，彼且惡乎待哉！故曰：至人無己，神人無功，聖人無名。

堯讓天下於許由，曰：「日月出矣，而爝火不息，其於光也，不亦難乎！時雨降矣，而猶浸灌，其於澤也，不亦勞乎！夫子立而天下治，而我猶尸之，吾自視缺然，請致天下。」許由曰：「子治天下，天下既已治也。而我猶代子，吾將為名乎？名者，實之賓也，吾將為賓乎？鷦鷯巢於深林，不過一枝；偃鼠飲河，不過滿腹。歸休乎君！予無所用天下為。庖人雖不治庖，尸祝不越樽俎而代之矣。」

肩吾問於連叔曰：「吾聞言於接輿，大而無當，往而不反。吾驚怖其言，猶河漢而無極也，大有逕庭，不近人情焉。」連叔曰：「其言謂何哉？」曰：「藐姑射之山，有神人居焉，肌膚若冰雪，淖約若處子，不食五穀，吸風飲露。乘雲氣，御飛龍，而遊乎四海之外。其神凝，使物不疵癘而年穀熟。吾以是狂而不信也。」連叔曰：「然，瞽者無以與乎文章之觀，聾者無以與乎鍾鼓之聲。豈唯形骸有聾盲哉？夫知亦有之。是其言也，猶時女也。之人也，之德也，將旁礡萬物，以為一世蘄乎亂，孰弊弊焉以天下為事！之人也，物莫之傷，大浸稽天而不溺，大旱、金石流、土山焦而不熱。是其塵垢粃糠，將猶陶鑄堯、舜者也，孰肯以物為事！宋人資章甫而適諸越，越人斷髮文身，無所用之。堯治天下之民，平海內之政，往見四子藐姑射之山，汾水之陽，窅然喪其天下焉。」

惠子謂莊子曰：「魏王貽我大瓠之種，我樹之成而實五石，以盛水漿，其堅不能自舉也。剖之以為瓢，則瓠落無所容。非不呺然大也，吾為其無用而掊之。」莊子曰：「夫子固拙於用大矣。宋人有善為不龜手之藥者，世世以洴澼絖為事。客聞之，請買其方百金。聚族而謀曰：『我世世為洴澼絖，不過數金；今一朝而鬻技百金，請與之。』客得之，以說吳王。越有難，吳王使之將。冬，與越人水戰，大敗越人，裂地而封之。能不龜手一也，或以封，或不免於洴澼絖，則所用之異也。今子有五石之瓠，何不慮以為大樽而浮乎江湖，而憂其瓠落無所容？則夫子猶有蓬之心也夫！」

惠子謂莊子曰：「吾有大樹，人謂之樗。其大本擁腫而不中繩墨，其小枝卷曲而不中規矩，立之塗，匠者不顧。今子之言，大而無用，眾所同去也。」莊子曰：「子獨不見狸狌乎？卑身而伏，以候敖者；東西跳梁，不避高下；中於機辟，死於罔罟。今夫斄牛，其大若垂天之雲。此能為大矣，而不能執鼠。今子有大樹，患其無用，何不樹之於無何有之鄉，廣莫之野，彷徨乎無為其側，逍遙乎寢臥其下？不夭斤斧，物無害者，無所可用，安所困苦哉！」"""@zh ;

    ns3:description """Gas’ real Chinese name is Chen Zhipeng 陈志鹏. He was born in 1989 in Chongzhou, a small town near Chengdu. He joined the hip-hop culture when he was twelve years old, through magazines and websites. The first tag he chose was Code321 and he used it only for 2 years. When he was fifteen, he started painting on walls, and at the age of nineteen he entered the "Chengdu Vocational Art Academy" (Environmental Art Design). At an early age he was named Shui Gui 水鬼 (Water Ghost), but the tag he has decided to use is GAS, which the artist reproduces in both Latin letters and Chinese characters (Qi 氣). His Chinese tag Qi 氣 is a translation of the word "Gas" and relates to the Chinese cultural concept of "vital energy", "vital force", "material energy", or simply "energy". "Qi 氣 is everywhere, even while you and I are talking right now", he has been quoted as saying.
Gas mostly uses his Chinese tag Qi 氣 as the main piece for his works. The character is produced in various shapes, techniques, colours and styles. In addition to the character qi 氣, Gas often uses other Chinese characters for his works, like Yu 雨 (Rain) or Feng 風 (Wind) written in non-simplified form.
GAS often creates works in collaboration with other artists, mostly for commercial purposes. In 2009, Gas struck up a friendship with Seven (or Seve), giving birth to an artistic-commercial duo named Hao Qiao 好巧 (How Chill). 
Gas’ art fits perfectly with that vein of "Chinese style graffiti" which is expressed using Chinese characters and/or references to Chinese cultural elements. In Gas’ works, a search for "Chineseness" and an attempt to develop a specific "Chinese style" is strongly palpable. 
Gas is the most representative writer on the Chengdu graffiti scene. He is: (1) one of the precursors of graffiti writing in Chengdu; (2) one of the first writers in China to use Chinese characters in his works; and (3) an ongoing "king" for young writers operating in the city. """@en ;

    ns2:title "Installation of the exhibition ”Wang Dongling:  The Bamboo Path” (王冬龄：竹径)" ;
    ns3:artwork-type <https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20437094> ;
    ns3:description """This installation is part of the exhibition held in 2017 in the hall A  OCAT Shenzhen.   This installation by Wang Dongling is a tribute to bamboo. The installation recreates a path composed of bamboo and calligraphy, which takes the viewer to a zone of vague perception, in a short walk of more than 20 meters of bamboo grove with 201 bamboo poles and 30 propylene panels written by the artist  with different script styles . This installation is an example of the variety in the usage of supports used by Wang Dongling for his calligraphy. The artist recreates a natural environment in an exhibition hall, in which viewers follow the path within the bamboo  grove. 
 Writing on bamboo shortens the temporal and spatial distance between us and pre-Qin scholars who used books made of bamboo strips to read, write, and study. Moreover, this installation emphasizes the cultural significance of bamboo in Chinese tradition. Bamboo has personified the literate for centuries. In the eyes of the literati, the bamboo is a symbol of righteousness and a noble spirit.
The installation recalls to mind the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove (Zhulin Qi Xian 竹林七贤), the gathering place of a group of Chinese scholars, writers, and musicians of the third century CE,  influential in Chinese poetry, music, and art. The Bamboo Grove is also associated with the Preface to the Poems composed at the Orchid Pavilion (Lanting Ji Xu. Wang Xizhi described the gathering of many literati engaged in the composition of poems during a wine-drinking competition in a location accompanied by high mountains and steep hills, as well as dense forests and tall bamboos (崇山峻領 ,茂林脩竹 ). On another occasion, Li He (790-816), a famous scholar of the Tang Dynasty, wrote Chu Ci about bamboo. In the same way as Li He, Wang Dongling wrote on bamboo poles, measuring 5 meters high and 12 to 15 centimeters in diameter, and propylene sheets with Chinese calligraphy written  using white acrylic paint are also part of the installation. Wang Dongling showcases  poems on bamboo by famous artists from past dynasties written on 201 bamboos using  The black ink of the writing on the poles interacts with the write acrylic on the propylene sheets, creating a dialogue between the calligraphic work realized by the artist.  Wang's calligraphic lines both on the bamboo poles and on the propylene sheets interact not only between them, but also with the shadows of the chaos script on the transparent panels reproduced by the light, intensifying a dynamic sense of flow and rhythm. In Chinese traditional culture, bamboo is one of the "Four Gentlemen" (si junzi 四君子) together with the plum blossom, orchid, and chrysanthemum. 
 Being exible enough to withstand storms without breaking, bamboo have been personified as the spiritual and cultural symbols of integrity, purity, modesty, and restraint, characteristics which Chinese gentlemen should all have.

The bamboo poles together with 30 proprylene transparent panels of of the exhibition ”Wang Dongling:  The Bamboo Path” were also readopted in the Zi·Canglang ting “自·沧浪亭” exhibition held in Suzhou 2018 and in the "Between Bamboo" solo exhibition (竹·间) held in Suzhou in July 2019. This exhibition is the third presentation of Wang Dongling's solo exhibition "The Bamboo Path".

Wang Dongling adopted transparent propylene panels and white acrylic paint as material to write his calligraphic works on several artworks and during several performances, such as:
- in the performance Zhuangzi · Enjoyment in Untroubled Ease (庄子 · 逍遥游) on the occasion of the "Edge of The Earth" - Asian Contemporary Art Invitation Exhibition (“De zhi yuan” - Yazhou dangdai yishu kaimu "地之缘" - 亚洲当代艺术開幕)  (Hangzhou, 2003)；
- in the Dao Xiang-Wang Dongling Calligraphy Art Exhibition (Dao xiang · Wang Dongling shufa yishu zhan 道象 · 王冬龄书法艺术展 ) held at the Imperial Ancestral Temple Art Museum in Beijing, 2016；
 - in the Calligraphic Performance “The Way that Can Be Spoken” (Dao Ke Dao  道可道) at the Victoria and Albert Museum (2016) during the London Craft Week;

Shariputra, form does not differ from emptiness; emptiness does not differ from form. Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself is form. So, too, are feeling, cognition, formation, and consciousness.
Shariputra, all dharmas are empty of characteristics. They are not produced. Not destroyed, not defiled, not pure, and they neither increase nor diminish.
Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, feeling, cognition, formation, or consciousness; no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no sights, sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, or dharmas; no field of the eyes, up to and including no field of mind-consciousness; and no ignorance or ending of ignorance, up to and including no old age and death or ending of old age and death. There is no suffering, no accumulating, no extinction, no way, and no understanding and no attaining.
Because nothing is attained, the Bodhisattva, through reliance on prajna paramita, is unimpeded in his mind. Because there is no impediment, he is not afraid, and he leaves distorted dream-thinking far behind. Ultimately Nirvana!
All Buddhas of the three periods of time attain Anuttarasamyaksambodhi through reliance on prajnaparamita. Therefore, know that prajna paramita is a great spiritual mantra, a great bright mantra, a supreme mantra, an unequaled mantra. It can remove all suffering; it is genuine and not false. That is why the mantra of prajna paramita was spoken. Recite it like this:

He reimagines traditional Chinese script and painting by incorporating unconventional materials into his artworks. One notable technique he employs involves accentuating certain elements by burning the material with incense or cigarettes, adding a unique texture and depth to his pieces.
Wang graduated from the Chinese Painting Department at the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (now the China Academy of Art) before obtaining his doctoral degree in the Calligraphy Department. Currently serving as a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, he continues to push the boundaries of traditional Chinese art forms.
His work has garnered international acclaim and is included in prestigious collections such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the British Museum, showcasing his significant contribution to contemporary Chinese art."""@en ;

Zhang Qiang realizes calligraphy, and each woman operates according to her own will, including the movement range of the paper, the size of the brush and the intensity of the ink used, and even when the performances will stop.  Zhang Qiang turned his side or back when writing, and no longer looked at the paper he was writing on. The content of the writing is realized extemporaneously. He sometimes writes recognizable Chinese characters and other times the characters are deconstructed due to the movement of the female counterpart. Since Zhang Qiang no longer looks at the paper, the woman can decide all the performance results. 
Each  collaboration includes 8 works on paper and sometimes also on plaster's geometric shapes. During the performance, other factors also come into play, such as the personal situation of the women, a dialogue with them, piped music, documentary photos of the performance process, and usually some spectators. However, performances are recorded only on rare occasions.
Variable system of the "Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/B Model":
(1) After B30, some cooperation began to be presented in the form of questions and answers.
(2) From B21, performances began to involve women from ethnic minorities. 
(3) From B24, performances began to involve foreign women.
(4) From B50, calligraphy began to appear on solid geometric shapes made of plaster.
(5) From B55, calligraphy began to be on swimsuit and bodies of the cooperating women.
(6) The calligraphy of the performance B94 is realized on clothes made of rice paper."""@en ;

    ns3:description """Huang Miaozi (1913-2012) is a towering figure in the Chinese art scene. His art blends old and new. Growing up in a Cantonese family in Hong Kong, at the time a British colony. He felt that he lightened the burden of being a British 'subject', by studying Chinese culture. He practiced calligraphy since childhood.
With the Japanese attack on China in 1932, the eighteen-year-old Huang decided to rush to Shanghai to enlist. After the Chinese government's decision to retaliate the attack, Huang remained in Shanghai, which he saw as the most thriving and cosmopolitan city in Asia, where the arts were also flourishing. Huang worked as a cartoonist and met  Yu Feng, his future wife, at the Cartoonists' Club.
As Japanese attacks intensified, Huang Miaozi followed the shift of the capital to Chongqing, which became China's vibrant cultural center and home to the leading artists and scholars of the time, including Guo Moruo. Besides these scholars, Huang met Zhou Enlai who took a liking to Huang fr his liberal views and sense of humour.
In the late 1940s Huang returned to Hong Kong. In 1949, shortly after the Communists had secured control of the mainland, he accepted their invitation to return to Beijing. For a while he worked in the new secretariat of the government headed by Zhou Enlai, but soon the opposition to the
the employment of non-party members in sensitive posts led him to leave government service and take up an editorial job at the People's Fine Arts Publishing House.
After the "Hundred Flowers Movement" of 1956-7, an anti-Rightists campaign put Huang in a difficult position. The Chongqing group of artists and writers was claimed to include nationalist spies and to plot against the communists. Labeled a "Rightist," Huang was despatched to northeastern China for "reform through labor." Huang was sent back to Beijing after a few months, probably thanks to a personal intervention by Zhon Enlai.
In Beijing, he wrote artist biographies at the Fine Arts Publishing House. His wife Yu Feng became the director of exhibitions at the newly opened China Art Gallery.The pleasures of the 60s were brief. Within a few years Huang and his wife had fallen victim of the Cultural Revolution. Both were imprisoned in 1968. The years of confinement turned Huang into a calligrapher. He tried to maintain his sanity by composing poems, paintings and calligraphy in his mind.
After seven years in prison, the couple was released in 1975 and  returned home. Huang, now sixty-two, decided to retire.
In the years of retirement, Huang was inspired by copies of calligraphic masters and worked in his own style for the first time. He used different styles to express his reflections on life and recent event, to enhance the power of each message: archaic characters for calm and reflective moods, powerful cursive characters to convey joy or anger.
Under the new climate of optimism with Deng Xiaoping's reforms, Huang was offered a spacious apartment in Beijing. In 1983, Huang was made a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) along with other scholars and artists who had suffered during the Cultural Revolution. These benefits included visits to Japan as well.
Huang was artistically attracted to Japan, where calligraphy had already been shaped into modern forms. To him it seemed almost like abstract art created with Chinese ink and encompassed ideas and research that he was already exploring. But the more he saw of Japanese art, the more he felt it lacked both the strength and depth of content of its Chinese counterpart.
Huang's participation in the controversial Modernist Calligraphy Exhibition held in Beijing in 1985 was
a more important factor in the further development of his art. "What made Huang's work stand out from many other exhibitions was the lyricism of his characters and the interrelationships between them. He brought a vitality to the ancient characters of seal script by writing them with speed and fluency. Furthermore, he made his works more like paintings by breaking with the tradition of writing characters in regular columns and instead arranging them on paper in freer artistic arrangements (Barrass)."

In 1988 Huang published his first calligraphy book. It contained more than seventy of his works, showing his mastery of the art of calligraphy, which has allowed him to create intriguing effects through the use of different ink densities and varying degrees of brush dryness. Equally important was his ability to combine an exploration of new forms of expression with a deep understanding of Chinese poetry and culture, often marked by a satirical edge. Not only did Huang demonstrated great skill in selecting appropriate quotations from his prodigious knowledge of the classics, but he also wrote poetry in the classical tradition. 
In the late 1980s Huang found himself involved in politics. A few days after the oppression in Tiananmen Square at the end of May 1989, he spoke out strongly in support of the protesters and for this, following the suppression of the demonstrations, Huang and Yu Feng, resentful of being forced to leave the country, fled to Australia.
Whilst waiting for an opportunity to return home, Huang traveled to Germany in 1992, where he met his young friend Gu Gan. The two arstis were boh visiting fellows at the Heinrich Böll Institute.
At the end of that year, an exhibition of their works (Huang Miaozi - Gu Gan) was held at the Museum für Ostasiatische Kunst in Cologne. It was the first major modern Chinese calligraphy exhibition held in Europe or the United States. Huang's most memorable piece from this exhibition was  Mit diesen Händen ("With These Hands").
After Germany, Huang and Yu Feng traveled to Great Britain, Italy, France, Switzerland, the United States and South Korea. Finally, they settled in Brisbane in 1993. Huang and Yu Feng  appreciated the quality of life Australia offered and had no difficulty keeping abreast of the latest developments in China. 
But they still hoped that the improved political climate at home would allow them to return one day. In 1993, they received a message from the Chinese authorities in which they hoped the couple would return to China. Returning in 1994, Huang and Yu Feng staged an exhibition in Beijing covering the full range of their works.
The exhibits of Huang's calligraphy included The Twittering Birds, The Flower in the Rough Ground, With these Hands, Great Changes, The Rain-filled Clouds, and The Gentlemanly Scholar, which together presented a clear statement of his views. The opening of the exhibition was a great event, which was attended by the major artists and art historians of the city.
The interest that Huang's work arouses and the pleasure it brings to so many people is attributable not only to the versatility of his technique, but also to his vast knowledge of the Chinese classics, his profound experience of life and politics, and of course his wicked sense of humor. His characteristic determination to make the best of things was heightened by the tragedies and vicissitudes of his own life. As some Chinese critics have observed, the enduring quality of his work and its "spiritual power" (ling qi 靈氣) is the most appropriate hallmark for a man than Huang's unwavering integrity."""@en ;

One of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, it is known for its psychological scope, and its observation of the worldview, aesthetics, life-styles, and social relations of 18th-century China. The intricate strands of its plot depict the rise and decline of a family much like Cao's own and, by extension, of the dynasty itself. Cao depicts the power of the father over the family, but the novel is intended to be a memorial to the women he knew in his youth: friends, relatives and servants. At a more profound level, the author explores religious and philosophical questions, and the writing style includes echoes of the plays and novels of the late Ming, as well as poetry from earlier periods."@en ;

    ns2:title "BJPZ crew" ;
    dcterms:description """The BJPZ The Beijing Penzi (BJPZ) was the first crew established in the city of Beijing. It was founded in 2006 by Li Qiuqiu (a.k.a. 0528), More (a.k.a. Mo), Soos and Als (from France), and was joined, two years later, by Zak, Quer and Corw (Valjakka 2016, p. 361). If truth be told, the date of their foundation is not entirely certain: in one interview, Li Qiuqiu states that it was around 2005, in another it was 2006 (ivi, p. 369), and on one of their blogs they mention February 2007. This is due to the informal nature with which the crew was formed: they are a group of friends who met almost by chance and share a passion for graffiti and (in several cases) skateboarding, which was the reason for their collaboration. 41-year-old More, whose real name is Wang Mo, recounts that he met Li Qiuqiu, the crew’s veteran, through skateboarding, and that the Beijing Penzi crew was born out of their desire to do something together (film Crayon 2012). Zak, whose real name is Zhang Lei, says that the idea to join the crew came after meeting More at his friend’s Soos’ birthday party. Only later did he have the opportunity to get in touch and hang out with Li Qiuqiu. In short, the foundation of this crew springs from a series of fortuitous and fortunate coincidences. Beijing Penzi is an all-round crew. As authors of both elaborate pieces and night-time bombing (which they love the most), the crew members collaborate with famous brands, and also create socially motivated works. They use both the Latin alphabet and Chinese characters in their large-scale works as well as in their tags or lettering on the side of their pieces, and all three Chinese co-founders of the crew (0528, Soos and More) write in both Latin letters and Chinese characters. Moreover, many figures animate the pieces of these writers, not only the large works but also the quick acts of street bombing, always with a keen eye on bringing out their Chinese cultural background. Still, the presence of the French artist Als proves the internationality and openness of the crew. Als undoubtedly influenced the development and evolution of the style of the entire group with his western background. In the words of Li Qiuqiu, the name Beijing Penzi 北京喷子, which means “Beijing writers”, was chosen because the term penzi – literally meaning “sprayer, atomizer” and, by extension, “writer” – is used in the Beijing dialect to refer to a garrulous person, and is also the name of a firearm. These two meanings tell us a lot about why the crew was created and what its programmatic aim is. As a matter of fact, according to Li Qiuqiu “[…] We would often have fun bombing together with friends, and so we decided to start our own crew” (interview, 2016). The idea behind the crew is therefore to reproduce a loquacious expressiveness that floods the audience of passers-by with a thousand words, using the force of a gunshot, but replacing bullets with written messages. What unites the members of the group is the pleasant sense of fulfilment that bombing gives them. The name of the crew also reveals their background and other purposes that hold them together: It’s not difficult to understand, from the name of our crew, that we come from the streets. We grew up immersed in the underground culture and we want to carry it forward and promote it. We wish to change the perception of graffiti art and make sure that graffiti is no longer seen as scribbles on the walls but can be accepted and appreciated by everyone. […] Our aim is to make graffiti in as Chinese a style as possible. All over the world graffiti is made using the English alphabet, but ours is not. In our works, we want to represent traditional architecture, the faces of Chinese people […] and Chinese writing, which is unique in the world. We don’t care what others may think of us, this is what we want to keep doing. That’s what graffiti is for us: we “play” with our culture. After all, we are “the Beijing writers” (Beijing penzi) and our background comes from the city most steeped in culture in all China. (Ibid.)
The BJPZ tags covered the city for a few years, especially the 3.3 underground car park in the Sanlitun neighbourhood, the 798 Art District, the overground Wudakou line, Nanluoguxiang street in the city centre, the Dawang bridge and the Xinjiekou area, as well as some of the main highways connecting the city, more precisely on Third and Fourth Ring Road North and the Third Ring Road West. Besides the traditional tagging-up, the 3D or bubble style throw-ups, and some bubble style blockbusters (mostly with the name Beijing Penzi), the crew members enjoyed playing with puppets or easily recognizable stylised figures in writing their tags. 0528 draws young boys' faces with oblong heads and typical Chinese features; More, whose tag seems to reproduce a flattened face with a beak and two large ears, adds a fun cone-shaped puppet with two prominent incisors and round ears; and Soos paints a Xiao R (小 R, Young R), a puppet with a flame-shaped head featuring only two dots serving as eyes, tapering hands and feet, and a stout body. This puppet is reminiscent of the shape of a virus whose task seems to be that of infesting the streets. When painted together with More's puppet, Xiao R is often accompanied by swirls and a beating heart, as a clear reference to the passion bonding these strange characters. The swirls, called xiandao 线道, literally "roads of lines" (Llys 2015), are a second recurring feature in Soos' works. They became his signature style, together with another element he invented, the "jellyfish clouds" (shuimo yiyun 水母意云): little cloud-shaped floral outgrowths arising from the tentacles of a jellyfish. The idea of the jellyfish is echoed in the sinuosity of the stems of these strange pom-pom flowers. The inspiration for the jellyfish clouds comes from the Kongming deng 孔明灯, a type of oil lamp with steam vents invented by one of the greatest strategists of ancient China, Zhuge Liang (181-234), whose public name was Kongming. The jellyfish clouds, together with Chinese writings, faces, and architectures, are meant to enhance a sense of "Chineseness", often expressed in BJPZ's works.
In addition to pieces with a strong social content, Beijing Penzi has created several works on commission. As Li Qiuqiu stated, the crew has collaborated with various brands, like Tiger Beer (part of Heineken Pacific Asia), Lee Jeans, Casio G-Shok (a wristwatch brand), Adidas, Nike, Panasonic and Haier (a Chinese home appliance company). We should also remember that this crew had a commercial orientation even before it was founded: as early as 2001, Li Qiuqiu and his friends created a brand called Shehui 社会 (Society) linked to the world of skateboarding, with the purpose of promoting events, activities and products connected with spreading this sport in China along with its related cultural industry. A few years later, together with the other members of the crew, Li Qiuqiu opened a design studio in Caochangdi – one of the most important art districts in the capital – where he could sell his art, write graffiti on commission, and keep decorating skateboards and other similar objects (Feola 2013). 
Therefore, the goal of their art is to develop a style that mirrors their Chinese origins (Valjakka 2016, p. 361). Indeed, in their works we find pieces in Chinese characters, Chinese writing and figurative elements that constantly recall the world of “China”."""@en ;

    ns3:description """Dezio is a French writer highly respected in Shanghai, started painting in 1994 in a little town in France called Le Mans when he was only fifteen years old. He continued ceaselessly to paint walls and in 2006 he moved to China, where the graffiti scene was basically just starting out. His first "international" crew was the CLW crew (acronym for "China’s Least Wanted", "Coloring Local Walls" or "Can’t Let’m Win"), founded with Jin Ye, Nine, Fluke and Storm. The crew also had other members in many different cities of the country like Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing and Honk Kong. The main aim of the crew was to combine writers from all over China and the world, who shared the same passion and vision of graffiti, under one "big family". 
Now Dezio lives and works in Shanghai, where he co-founded Urban Art United (UAU), an urban art agency based in Shanghai since 2017 that connects people with art in China.
Before following the post-graffiti trend and becoming a well-rounded artist, Dezio often used Chinese characters in his works and signed with his Chinese tag (Duxi’ao 度西奥). 
Dezio said that Chinese local artists believed it was impossible to write with Chinese characters, and yet, despite being French, Dezio proved them wrong. He explained how any character or letter can be divided into strokes and each stroke can be reworked in a personal style. Then, that "personalized stroke" can be combined with others to make a piece. In fact, every time he travels in Asia, Dezio always tries to paint in the local language, even if he doesn’t know how to write it, reproducing this "strokes re-combination" concept. This highlights a very intercultural way of doing graffiti which allows a true dialogue with diversity, giving new life to walls in which the only protagonist is Art.
With Dezio, the use of Chinese characters is not limited to his tag but also to a series of works with Chinese characters, each time with a different intent. 
"He has had a recognizable impact on the development of contemporary graffiti in the city. His works have exhibited playful yet skillful engagement with contemporary graffiti for around two decades. Dezio is known not only for his accomplished alphabets but also for his elaborate Chinese writing, which he uses even for his own name (Duxi’ao 度西奥)" (Valjakka 2016, 364).

    ns2:title "Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/C Model (张强踪迹学报告 A/C 模型)" ;
    ns3:description """The series begins in 2002 and ends in 2018. Zhang Qiang realizes collaborative performances of "Action Writing" (xingwei shuxie 行为书写). The artist experiments performances with both female artists' naked bodies and/or clothes made by fashion designers. In the second case, the female counterparts decide the design and material of the clothes they will wear.  Very often the clothes are made with a type of traditional silk called juan 绢, as a reference to the ancients: Chinese paintings before the Yuan dynasty, in fact, were painted on silk.
This series has three main features: 
1. During the performance,  Zhang Qiang does not look at the counterpart's body, so the female counterpart has only the lens of the camera in front of her body. The artist's hand is in constant motion and holds a brush dipped in ink. The female counterpart constantly feels the existence of the "other" from the writing on her body through the brush. At the same time, since there is no direct gaze scrutinizing her body, she can ignore or even forget the existence of the "other" at any moment. During this process, approaching or avoiding the body will lead to distinct and unexpected movements.
2. The places of these performances are similar to "study spaces", with artificial lights, different scenarios and backgrounds.
3. The cooperative women are basically students of Academies of Fine Arts. These girls are immersed in the process of modern visual education and have fashion sensitivity, so they make unusual and personalized clothes. 
This series has a subcategory called "Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/X Model" (Zhang Qiang zongji xue baogao A/X moxing  张强踪迹学报告 A/X 模型, 2013 - 2018). The A/X series is more experimental and "free" than the "A/C" series, because it puts more emphasis on the initiative of female collaborators.
The "Zhang Qiang's Traceology Report A/X Model"  consists of about thirteen "free performances" (ziyou xingwei 自由行为) . These performances place greater emphasis on the concepts and initiatives of the counterpart. For example in the performance entitled "Zhang Qiang Traceology Report A/X 7 (Zhang Kaini) [张强踪迹学报告A/X 7 (张凯妮）模型]", Zhang Kaini, the female counterpart, pays close attention to express her thoughts during the performance.

    ns3:description "This is an ancient Chinese poem from the anthology Chuci traditionally attributed to Qu Yuan. Li Sao dates from the 3rd century BCE, during the Chinese Warring States period. Qu Yuan manifests himself in a poetic character, in the tradition of Classical Chinese poetry, contrasting with the anonymous poetic voices encountered in the Shijing and the other early poems which exist as preserved in the form of incidental incorporations into various documents of ancient miscellany. The rest of the Chuci anthology is centered on the \"Li Sao\", the purported biography of its author Qu Yuan. In \"Li Sao\", the poet despairs that he has been plotted against by evil factions at court with his resulting rejection by his lord and then recounts a series of shamanistic spirit journeys to various mythological realms, engaging or attempting to engage with a variety of divine or spiritual beings, with the theme of the righteous minister unfairly rejected sometimes becoming exaggerated in the long history of later literary criticism and allegorical interpretation. It dates from the time of King Huai of Chu, in the third century BCE."@en ;
    ns3:trascription-or-translation """Of the god-king Gao-yang I am the far offspring,
My late honored sire bore the name of Bo-yong.
The she-ti stars aimed to the year's first month;
Geng-yin was the day that I came down.

He scanned and delved into my first measure,
From the portents my sire gave these noble names:
The name that he gave me was Upright Standard;
And my title of honor was Godly Poise.

Such bounty I had of beauty within,
And to this was added fair countenance.
I wore mantles of river rush and remote angelica,
Strung autumn orchids to hang from my sash.

I knelt with robes open, thus stated my case,
Having grasped so clearly what is central and right.
I teamed jade white dragons, rode the Bird that Hides Sky,
Waiting on winds to fleetly fare upward.

At dawn I loosed wheel-block there by Cang-wu,
And by twilight I reached the Gardens of Air.
I wished to bide a while by the windows of gods,
But swift was the sun and it soon would be dusk.

I bade sun-driver Xi-he, to pause in her pace,
To stand off from Yan-zi and not to draw night.
On and on stretched my road, long it was and far,
I would go high and go low in this search that I made.

I watered my horses in the Pools of Xian,
And twisted the reins on the tree Fu-sang,
I snapped a branch of the Ruo Tree to block out the sun,
I roamed freely the while and lingered there.

Those men of faction had ill-gotten pleasures,
Their paths went in shadow, narrow, unsafe.
Not for myself came this dread of doom—
I feared my king's chariot soon would be tipped.

In haste I went dashing in front and behind,
Till I came to the tracks of our kings before.
Lord Iris did not fathom my nature within,
He believed ill words, he glowered in rage.

I knew well my bluntness had brought me these woes,
Yet I bore through them, I could not forswear.
I pointed to Heaven to serve as my warrant,
It was all for the cause of the Holy One.

It is now done forever!
In all the kingdom there is no man, no man who knows me,
Then why should I care for that city, my home?
Since no one will join me in making good rule,
I will go off to seek where Peng and Xian dwell."""@en,

    ns3:description """Chen Guangwu is a prominent Chinese artist. Born in Guangxi, 1967, Chen's artistic journey began at a young age, driven by a passion for traditional Chinese art forms. Trained at the [Name of Academy], Chen's artistic vision merges traditional calligraphy with contemporary sensibilities, resulting in dynamic and expressive artworks that push the boundaries of the art form. Chen Guangwu's artworks have been exhibited extensively both in China and internationally, garnering acclaim for their innovation and artistic vision. Through a diverse range of materials and techniques, from traditional ink brushwork to experimental digital methods, Chen creates compositions that captivate viewers and challenge conventional perceptions of Chinese calligraphy. His works often feature abstract and experimental elements, exploring concepts of movement, space, and form within the realm of calligraphic expression.
Chen Guangwu's innovative exploration of repetition, layering (overwriting, rewriting), and deconstruction forms the core of his creative process. The essence of Chen's artworks can also be divided into these three main categories (Iezzi 2014, p. 439-440): i) the repetition of a single character until space saturation, ii) the layering of different words overlaid, and iii) the breakdown of characters into their component parts, followed by their multiple reiterations.

    ns2:title "ABS crew" ;
    dcterms:description """ABS is one of the most eclectic and comprehensive crews in mainland China today and certainly the best known and most active in Beijing. It was founded in 2007 by Scar (a.k.a. Smer), Seven, Andc and Noise, and joined in 2015 by Goes, a writer from Chengdu. Scar and Seven, the veterans of the crew, started as writers in 2005, Andc, the social soul of ABS, in 2006, and Noise the following year, when the four decided to create the group (Valjakka 2016, p. 361).
The name ABS is an acronym that has acquired several meanings over the years, the first of which is “Around the Bohai Sea”. The Bohai Sea is the innermost gulf of the Yellow Sea on the northeast coast of China, very close to the city of Beijing. It was chosen because the founders of the crew come from cities near the gulf, also known as Bohai Bay: Andc from Beijing, Seven from Tianjin, Noise from Dalian in the Liaoning province, and Scar from Shijiazhuang, the capital of the Hebei province (Wu 2014, p. 1). The second meaning is “Active, Brilliant, Significant” (Fitch 2012), referring to the qualities the crew seeks for their works. “A Brand New Start” is the third meaning, and the group’s greatest wish: a new mode for graffiti art to be created in China that represents the union of American and Chinese culture (2015 interview with Andc). The fourth and final meaning is “Anti-lock Braking System” (Valjakka 2016, p. 369) or “Anti-skid Brake System” (Wu 2014, p. 1) which implies the intent to follow the original idea of graffiti and standing firm on that path. 
In 2010, the members of the crew moved to Beijing and established their studio in the 798 Art District. In 2012, they opened China’s first graffiti store, called “400ML”, where they sold imported spray paint cans, books, graffiti-related items and their own original products, but most importantly, they created a hub for the promotion and spread of Chinese graffiti culture. The name of the shop was chosen because the standard capacity of the spray cans used for graffiti is 400 ml, but also because it stands as an acronym for “4” young Chinese people (the founders of the crew) who wish to be called Mr. Letter – “ML” – and dedicate “100” per cent of their time and skills to the art of graffiti (ibid.). The crew decided to open this commercial space after a trip to Europe during which they first had the opportunity to use European paints and realized the poor quality of the Chinese spray cans which, according to them, “smelled like industrial paint and had a much smaller variety of colors” (ivi, p. 3). Thus, they decided to start selling European cans in China in order to offer better quality products for the creation of successful graffiti.
This trip to Europe, forming part of the 2011-12 EU-China Hip-Hop Communication Project, an exchange project between China and Europe dedicated to urban culture, marked a breakthrough for the crew. They were able to participate after winning the 2011 Wall Lords Asia Graffiti Battle, Asia’s greatest graffiti competition, held in Taiwan and attended by the main crews from the major Asian countries (Philippines, Singapore, Japan, Korea, People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan). Here, the crew was noticed by a German judge who invited them to participate in the exchange project (ivi, p. 2). In thirty days, the ABS travelled from Berlin to Rotterdam and painted countless walls in the ten cities they crossed, together with other European writers, learning the German writing style and techniques. This was the turning point for the art of the ABS crew, who had originally worked with Chinese characters following the US styles. From this point on, they firmly changed course, abandoning charactering in favor of lettering, and searching for their own personal writing style, which became increasingly internationalized without every entirely losing sight of their Chinese origins.  After this first phase, however, the crew almost completely abandoned charactering in favor of the Latin alphabet and English language. This gave rise to works of a completely opposite nature to the earlier ones, but in which the western influence continued to be very present and almost “oppressive”. One example is "Poseidon" created by the ABS crew in 2011 during the China Wall Lords Graffiti Battle in Chengdu, in which nothing seems to lead back to their Chinese origins. In 2011 and 2012, they participated in the Wall Lords Graffiti Battles and won both the Chinese and Asian competitions. In 2011, the theme of the Chinese graffiti battle was classicism. They therefore chose to portray Poseidon, to recall the peculiar traits of ancient Greek mythology. (Interview, 2016) Later, mainly due to their participation in the 2011-12 EU-China Hip-Hop Communication Project, the crew shifted to mostly lettering works, possibly featuring elements that plainly recall the group’s “Chineseness”, like dragons, pandas, pagodas and small calligraphic inscriptions, and certainly seeking a manifest stylistic recognizability. From 2012 onwards, plainly “Chinese” graffiti alternate with pieces in which “Chineseness” remains completely opaque, if not invisible, and which seem to aim for a very personal and recognizable style that clearly defines the identity of the ABS crew, regardless of its origin. Examples include the two graffiti pieces created for the Wall Lords Graffiti Battles in 2012, both the national and the Asian one, shortly after participating in the exchange project with Europe. As evidenced by these pieces, since then the art of the ABS crew has focused particularly on large-format and artistically elaborate works, mainly in wild style, with strong funky hints and comic-cartoon style references (Valjakka 2016, p. 362). The layout of their pieces has also become more and more defined and consolidated: in most cases the pieces consist of large alphabetical inscriptions on kaleidoscopic backgrounds, mainly featuring the tags of some of the crew members (Wu 2014) and animated by amusing puppets placed in the center of the composition.  Therefore, in terms of writing, the ABS crew significantly prefers to use the Latin alphabet, while in terms of puppets and decorative elements, they combine references to Chinese and western characters, as well as to the hip-hop culture. Indeed, b-boys (breakdancers), skateboarders, graffiti writers and guys wearing hip-hop clothes are recurring figures. References to “Chineseness” are more frequent in foreign works, while those in characters are only created on Chinese soil (since they would be incomprehensible outside). Despite all these distinctions, the style of the crew has gradually been shaped and defined since 2012, becoming more recognizable, regardless of the type of writing and puppets used. It is a very “international” style, easy to read and appreciate even abroad. This desire for “internationalization” is visible not only in the crew’s style but also in the way they operate. Since their participation in the 2011-12 EU-China Hip-Hop Communication Project, the crew has engaged in frequent collaborations with foreign writers in China and abroad. In Beijing they worked with the Italian Sbam and the German Zyko. They have also participated in worldwide graffiti art festivals (especially in Europe and the United States, like the Berlin Mural Fest in 2018), and organized international graffiti-related events, including “Graffiti On and Meeting Neighborhood”, an annual non-commercial event organized in Beijing in collaboration with the local government, which attracts graffiti writers from all over the world and aims to introduce graffiti to a wider audience. Their blog pages are filled with photos of trips to the United States and Europe (Crayon 2017), especially those of Andc, who visited Germany twice in 2018 (Yau 2018). This tells us a lot about the crew’s desire for “internationality”, while always remaining faithful to their culture of origin.
The internationalization of graffiti carried out by the crew goes hand in hand with its commercial breakthrough. It can be affirmed that “the ABS crew led the way veering towards the commercial side of graffiti” (Bonniger 2018, p. 24), and it is no coincidence that they have a business development director, Wendy (Valjakka 2016, p. 369), who takes care of the growth of their brand and relations with potential clients. The commercial success of the crew is not only linked to the 400ML shop, but also to numerous collaborations with famous brands, like Red Bull, Adidas, Puma, Nike, Audi, Volkswagen, TAGHeuer and Ispo, for which they create works on commission. However, the crew strongly emphasizes that these collaborations do not affect their creative activity in any way and should therefore not be seen in a negative light. Thus, finding a way to earn money through creative activity is a blessing. In fact, it is no coincidence that the ABS is the longest-running crew in Beijing, as its members have managed to turn graffiti into a job. Even though this may be controversial, one should understand the peculiarities of the Chinese environment, where young people are subjected to heavy family pressures, society is extremely competitive, and most people do not even know what graffiti is. The crew is uncompromising about respecting their creative freedom in these collaborations. Although these works advertise brands or products and writers have to adhere to the theme of the piece, they must feel free to paint and represent whatever they want, choosing their desired style.
The crew also collaborates with the government on specific projects: in 2014, for example, they painted ten city shuttle buses during the government-sponsored art festival in Beijing’s Central Business District (CBD). This kind of collaboration may seem contradictory in the graffiti context, but again we have to make an effort to identify with the background in which the group operates. Even though the crew has its own shop with branded products, collaborates with famous brands, can count on government support, and participates in public art commissions, they have never stopped making illegal graffiti on the streets of the city. 
On the contrary, as the ABS has repeatedly pointed out, all these jobs largely serve to finance activities on the fringes of legality and to get more liberty to “bomb” the streets of Beijing with their tags. Andc constantly mentions the ABS’s “obscure” work. This takes place “at night on the streets” (ibid.) and stems from the desire to cover the city with their tags, to “say something to people and make works that are comments on society” (ibid.). There are several tags, throw-ups, blockbusters or even more elaborate pieces created on abandoned or soon-to-be-demolished buildings. Some members of the crew even write on train cars, a real rarity in China where graffiti of this kind is not allowed and thus extremely dangerous. Of equal importance are their works serving as a social exposé. 
In conclusion, it emerges that the ABS is an extremely multifaceted crew, and indeed the most versatile in Beijing. Its creative activity ranges from illegal street bombing to collaborations with famous commercial brands; from work on halls of fame granted by government authorities, to the creative assault of abandoned buildings on the outskirts of the city; from exposé pieces on skeletons of industrial archaeology, to design works for merchandising products. Their style is strongly influenced by the Euro-American tradition and steeped in hip-hop culture. It is characterized by strong wildstyle accents and funky notes, and mostly eschews the use of Chinese characters, although at times it presents references to their culture of origin, especially in the choice of puppets and decorative motifs. The crew is increasingly opening its style to the world, also thanks to its international vocation. However, its focus remains firmly on Chinese soil, and its ultimate aim is to promote and spread graffiti culture in China. According to Andc, the main intention for the future is to put “all possible energy into making graffiti an increasingly popular art form and to involve more and more young people in this activity” (interview, 2015)."""@en ;

    ns2:title "ANDC" ;
    ns3:description "His real name is Chen Chuang and his tag derives from the expression “And-Chen”. His approach to the world of graffiti derived from American writing. His first encounter with graffiti came through two documentary films on hip-hop culture: Wild Style (1983), which tells the story of New York’s street culture in the early 1980s, and Style Wars (1983), about a young graffiti artist from New York who used to paint underground cars in those years. From then on, Andc started painting graffiti together with a few friends, earning money from it and thus deciding to continue this rather fulfilling activity. From merely imitating American writing, Andc evolved to creating works in Chinese characters through which he could express its distinctive style. Examples of these early attempts are Zhanzheng wuqing 战争无情 (The Ruthlessness of War) and Tuo qi xiwang 托起希望 (Raising Hope) of 2009, produced in memory of tragic events in recent Chinese history, respectively the Nanjing Massacre of 1937 (a series of atrocities perpetrated by the Japanese army against the Chinese civilian population at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War) and the Sichuan earthquake of 12 May 2008, which claimed approximately seventy thousand victims. The two pieces are wild style renderings of the four characters of the title inspired by a chengyu, a common pattern with other crews (e.g. the Kwanyin Clan). The writing style is very edgy and basic, consisting of one or two fill-in colors spread evenly, a single outline, and only occasionally a hint of 3D. The result is somewhat “rigid” and reveals the embryonic state of his personal stylistic research, centered on the attempt to reshape Chinese writing by imitating American styles."@en ;

    ns3:calligraphic-formation "Present (not specified)"@en ;
    ns3:description """In his career of three decades, Wei Ligang (b. 1964) has sought a universal language of abstraction based on the linear and spatial compositions of Chinese writing, a language capable of embodying the complexity and expansiveness of contemporary human knowledge and existence. His signature “magic squares,” which preserve the structure and strokes of Chinese characters and hark back to the pictographic origins of Chinese writing, are one of the earliest examples of a distinctly personal language in contemporary Chinese art. Wei Ligang generalizes the continuous cursive calligraphy of the 17th-century Shanxi calligrapher Fu Shan, applying it to the seal, clerical, and Oracle Bone scripts of antiquity to create the distinctive script styles of epigraphic mad cursive, “gold-ink cursive,” and “shadow cursive.” Wei Ligang is also the author of a celebrated body of calligraphy-informed abstract paintings.
Wei Ligang’s art is a unique fusion of systematic thought and sensibility, delicacy and spirituality, exoticism and naturalness. His wide-ranging inspirations include ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, industrial civilization and modern machines, European castles and palaces, contemporary physics and astronomy, and the structures of animals and plants. He employs the bright colors of gold, red, and blue, and uses acrylic paints to increase substance and texture. In these respects his art differs from traditional Chinese calligraphy, which typically is monochrome and privileges fluency.
Wei Ligang was born in Datong, the first capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534) and home to the famous Buddhist grotto shrines of Yungang, which instilled in him a fondness for the grandeur of Han and Tang-dynasty art. Wei’s father, an art-loving railroad worker, inspired his interest in mechanics and calligraphy. At age 17, Wei entered the mathematics department of Nankai University, where he honed his logical and analytical skills. As President of the university calligraphy society, he came under the mentorship of the local masters Li Henian (1912-2000), Wang Xuezhong (1925-2013), and Sun Boxiang (1934-) in classical poetry and epigraphic scripts. Wang Xuezhong, an early pioneer of Modern Calligraphy, was especially influential to Wei.
After graduating from Nankai in 1985, Wei Ligang became a teacher at a normal school in Taiyuan and immersed himself in the legacy of Fu Shan, a fellow Shanxi native. In 1995, he relocated to the Old Summer Palace in Beijing as a professional artist, and thereafter increasingly engaged with abstract painting and international contemporary art. Over the 90’s, Wei gained prominence as a young pioneer of Modern Calligraphy, participating and organizing a number of influential exhibitions in the field, including Bashu Parade: A Review of China Modern Calligraphy At The End of 20th Century in 1999 in Chengdu. A committed educator and the founder of the International Shuxiang Society, he believes that Chinese calligraphy will reach an unprecedented height within this generation. He aims to develop “writing” (shuxie) into an art form capable of embodying all phenomena and things in the universe and a way to construct “pure structure itself.”
Wei Ligang was the recipient of the 2005 Asian Cultural Council Dr. Joseph K. W. Li Arts Fellowship. His works are in the collections of the Asian Art Museum, San Francisco; British Museum; Cernuschi Museum, Paris; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle; National Museum of China, Beijing; National Art Museum of China, Beijing; François-Henri Pinault Family, France; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; among others."""@en ;

    ns2:title "Heart Sutra (心經)" ;
    ns3:description """The Heart Sūtra ( Xīnjīng 心經) is a popular sutra in Mahāyāna Buddhism. In Sanskrit, the title Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya translates as "The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom". 
According to traditional accounts, the Heart Sūtra was composed by a Sarvastivadan monk in the 1st century CE in Kushan Empire territory, and it was first translated into Chinese in approximately 200-250CE. However, there is currently a lack of scholarly consensus on the original author and origin of the Heart Sutra. Contemporary scholar Jan Nattier (1992) theorizes (based on her study of Chinese and Sanskrit texts) that the Heart Sutra may have initially been composed in China. Other scholars, such as Fukui, Harada, Ishii and Siu, based on their study of Chinese and Sanskrit texts of the Heart Sutra and other medieval period Sanskrit Mahayana sutras, theorize that the Heart Sutra could not have been composed in China but was composed in India.
The Sutra famously states, "Form is emptiness (śūnyatā), emptiness is form." It is a condensed exposé on the Buddhist Mahayana teaching of the Two Truths doctrine, which says that ultimately all phenomena are Śūnyatā (emptiness). It has been called "the most frequently used and recited text in the entire Mahayana Buddhist tradition." 
The Heart Sutra is said to present the heart, or the essence, of the Prajnaparamita teachings, which are the definitive teachings on the Mahayana view of the interdependent nature of reality. The Prajnaparamita teachings as a whole comprise a large corpus of literature, including sutras of great length, and many commentaries by great masters of India, East Asia and Tibet. These teachings are revered within the Mahayana tradition as representing the highest, most subtle view of the nature of reality. The Heart Sutra, which is no more than a page in length, presents an essential summary of this view. The Heart Sutra is the most well-known and most commonly recited Mahayana sutra, particularly in East Asia, where it is common for monks and lay practitioners to recite the Heart Sutra daily. Thupten Jinpa writes: “Even today, the chanting of this sutra can be heard in Tibetan monasteries, where it is recited in the characteristically deep overtone voice, in Japanese Zen temples, where the chanting is done in tune with rhythmic beating of a drum, and in Chinese and the Vietnamese temples, where it is sung in melodious tunes.”
Chanting the Heart Sutra is a popular Buddhist practice in East Asia for several reasons. First, it is one of the shortest sacred texts, which makes it convenient for even people who lead busy lives. Despite being short, it’s very condensed: it can be easily considered to contain the very essence of Buddhist wisdom. Hence the full title: The Heart (essence) of the Perfection of Wisdom (Prajnaparamita).
Second, it’s a sutra whose main character is Guanyin Bodhisattva (appearing with another name, Guanzizai (觀自在), which is another Chinese translation of the Sanskrit Avalokitesvara. Guanyin, the personification of the Buddhist ideal of Compassion, often seen as a mother-figure is immensely popular among practitioners. This adds to the popularity of the Heart Sutra as well.

    ns3:trascription-or-translation """When Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva was practicing the profound prajnaparamita, he illuminated the five skandhas and saw that they are all empty, and he crossed beyond all suffering and difficulty.
Shariputra, form does not differ from emptiness; emptiness does not differ from form. Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself is form. So, too, are feeling, cognition, formation, and consciousness.
Shariputra, all dharmas are empty of characteristics. They are not produced. Not destroyed, not defiled, not pure, and they neither increase nor diminish.
Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, feeling, cognition, formation, or consciousness; no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no sights, sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, or dharmas; no field of the eyes, up to and including no field of mind-consciousness; and no ignorance or ending of ignorance, up to and including no old age and death or ending of old age and death. There is no suffering, no accumulating, no extinction, no way, and no understanding and no attaining.
Because nothing is attained, the Bodhisattva, through reliance on prajna paramita, is unimpeded in his mind. Because there is no impediment, he is not afraid, and he leaves distorted dream-thinking far behind. Ultimately Nirvana!
All Buddhas of the three periods of time attain Anuttarasamyaksambodhi through reliance on prajnaparamita. Therefore, know that prajna paramita is a great spiritual mantra, a great bright mantra, a supreme mantra, an unequaled mantra. It can remove all suffering; it is genuine and not false. That is why the mantra of prajna paramita was spoken. Recite it like this:
Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!
Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!
Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!

 """@en ;
    ns3:trascription-or-translation """In the Northern Ocean there is a fish, the name of which is Kun - I do not know how many li in size. It changes into a bird with the name of Peng, the back of which is (also) - I do not know how many li in extent. When this bird rouses itself and flies, its wings are like clouds all round the sky. When the sea is moved (so as to bear it along), it prepares to remove to the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean is the Pool of Heaven.
There is the (book called) Qi Xie, a record of marvels. We have in it these words: 'When the peng is removing to the Southern Ocean it flaps (its wings) on the water for 3000 li. Then it ascends on a whirlwind 90,000 li, and it rests only at the end of six months.' (But similar to this is the movement of the breezes which we call) the horses of the fields, of the dust (which quivers in the sunbeams), and of living things as they are blown against one another by the air. Is its azure the proper colour of the sky? Or is it occasioned by its distance and illimitable extent? If one were looking down (from above), the very same appearance would just meet his view.
And moreover, (to speak of) the accumulation of water; if it be not great, it will not have strength to support a large boat. Upset a cup of water in a cavity, and a straw will float on it as if it were a boat. Place a cup in it, and it will stick fast; the water is shallow and the boat is large. (So it is with) the accumulation of wind; if it be not great, it will not have strength to support great wings. Therefore (the peng ascended to) the height of 90,000 li, and there was such a mass of wind beneath it; thenceforth the accumulation of wind was sufficient. As it seemed to bear the blue sky on its back, and there was nothing to obstruct or arrest its course, it could pursue its way to the South.
A cicada and a little dove laughed at it, saying, 'We make an effort and fly towards an elm or sapanwood tree; and sometimes before we reach it, we can do no more but drop to the ground. Of what use is it for this (creature) to rise 90,000 li, and make for the South?' He who goes to the grassy suburbs, returning to the third meal (of the day), will have his belly as full as when he set out; he who goes to a distance of 100 li will have to pound his grain where he stops for the night; he who goes a thousand li, will have to carry with him provisions for three months. What should these two small creatures know about the matter? The knowledge of that which is small does not reach to that which is great; (the experience of) a few years does not reach to that of many. How do we know that it is so? The mushroom of a morning does not know (what takes place between) the beginning and end of a month; the short-lived cicada does not know (what takes place between) the spring and autumn. These are instances of a short term of life. In the south of Chu there is the (tree) called Ming-ling, whose spring is 500 years, and its autumn the same; in high antiquity there was that called Da-chun, whose spring was 8000 years, and its autumn the same. And Peng Zu is the one man renowned to the present day for his length of life: if all men were (to wish) to match him, would they not be miserable?

n the questions put by Tang to Ji we have similar statements: 'In the bare and barren north there is the dark and vast ocean - the Pool of Heaven. In it there is a fish, several thousand li in breadth, while no one knows its length. Its name is the kun. There is (also) a bird named the peng; its back is like the Tai mountain, while its wings are like clouds all round the sky. On a whirlwind it mounts upwards as on the whorls of a goat's horn for 90,000 li, till, far removed from the cloudy vapours, it bears on its back the blue sky, and then it shapes its course for the South, and proceeds to the ocean there.' A quail by the side of a marsh laughed at it, and said, 'Where is it going to? I spring up with a bound, and come down again when I have reached but a few fathoms, and then fly about among the brushwood and bushes; and this is the perfection of flying. Where is that creature going to?' This shows the difference between the small and the great.

Thus it is that men, whose wisdom is sufficient for the duties of some one office, or whose conduct will secure harmony in some one district, or whose virtue is befitting a ruler so that they could efficiently govern some one state, are sure to look on themselves in this manner (like the quail), and yet Rongzi of Song would have smiled and laughed at them. (This Rongzi), though the whole world should have praised him, would not for that have stimulated himself to greater endeavour, and though the whole world should have condemned him, would not have exercised any more repression of his course; so fixed was he in the difference between the internal (judgment of himself) and the external (judgment of others), so distinctly had he marked out the bounding limit of glory and disgrace. Here, however, he stopped. His place in the world indeed had become indifferent to him, but still he had not planted himself firmly (in the right position). There was Liezi, who rode on the wind and pursued his way, with an admirable indifference (to all external things), returning, however, after fifteen days, (to his place). In regard to the things that (are supposed to) contribute to happiness, he was free from all endeavours to obtain them; but though he had not to walk, there was still something for which he had to wait. But suppose one who mounts on (the ether of) heaven and earth in its normal operation, and drives along the six elemental energies of the changing (seasons), thus enjoying himself in the illimitable - what has he to wait for? Therefore it is said, 'The Perfect man has no (thought of) self; the Spirit-like man, none of merit; the Sagely-minded man, none of fame.'

Yao, proposing to resign the throne to Xu You, said, 'When the sun and moon have come forth, if the torches have not been put out, would it not be difficult for them to give light? When the seasonal rains are coming down, if we still keep watering the ground, will not our toil be labour lost for all the good it will do? Do you, Master, stand forth (as sovereign), and the kingdom will (at once) be well governed. If I still (continue to) preside over it, I must look on myself as vainly occupying the place - I beg to resign the throne to you.' Xu You said, 'You, Sir, govern the kingdom, and the kingdom is well governed. If I in these circumstances take your place, shall I not be doing so for the sake of the name? But the name is but the guest of the reality; shall I be playing the part of the guest? The tailor-bird makes its nest in the deep forest, but only uses a single branch; the mole drinks from the He, but only takes what fills its belly. Return and rest in being ruler - I will have nothing to do with the throne. Though the cook were not attending to his kitchen, the representative of the dead and the officer of prayer would not leave their cups and stands to take his place.'

Jian Wu asked Lian Shu, saying, 'I heard Jie Yu talking words which were great, but had nothing corresponding to them (in reality); once gone, they could not be brought back. I was frightened by them; they were like the Milky Way which cannot be traced to its beginning or end. They had no connexion with one another, and were not akin to the experiences of men.' 'What were his words?' asked Lian Shu, and the other replied, (He said) that 'Far away on the hill of Gu Ye there dwelt a Spirit-like man whose flesh and skin were (smooth) as ice and (white) as snow; that his manner was elegant and delicate as that of a virgin; that he did not eat any of the five grains, but inhaled the wind and drank the dew; that he mounted on the clouds, drove along the flying dragons, rambling and enjoying himself beyond the four seas; that by the concentration of his spirit-like powers he could save men from disease and pestilence, and secure every year a plentiful harvest.' These words appeared to me wild and incoherent and I did not believe them. 'So it is,' said Lian Shu. 'The blind have no perception of the beauty of elegant figures, nor the deaf of the sound of bells and drums. But is it only the bodily senses of which deafness and blindness can be predicated? There is also a similar defect in the intelligence; and of this your words supply an illustration in yourself. That man, with those attributes, though all things were one mass of confusion, and he heard in that condition the whole world crying out to him to be rectified, would not have to address himself laboriously to the task, as if it were his business to rectify the world. Nothing could hurt that man; the greatest floods, reaching to the sky, could not drown him, nor would he feel the fervour of the greatest heats melting metals and stones till they flowed, and scorching all the ground and hills. From the dust and chaff of himself, he could still mould and fashion Yaos and Shuns - how should he be willing to occupy himself with things?' A man of Song, who dealt in the ceremonial caps (of Yin), went with them to Yue, the people of which cut off their hair and tattooed their bodies, so that they had no use for them. Yao ruled the people of the kingdom, and maintained a perfect government within the four seas. Having gone to see the four (Perfect) Ones on the distant hill of Gu Ye, when (he returned to his capital) on the south of the Fen water, his throne appeared no more to his deep-sunk oblivious eyes.

Huizi told Zhuangzi, saying, 'The king of Wei sent me some seeds of a large calabash, which I sowed. The fruit, when fully grown, could contain five piculs (of anything). I used it to contain water, but it was so heavy that I could not lift it by myself. I cut it in two to make the parts into drinking vessels; but the dried shells were too wide and unstable and would not hold (the liquor); nothing but large useless things! Because of their uselessness I knocked them to pieces.' Zhuangzi replied, 'You were indeed stupid, my master, in the use of what was large. There was a man of Song who was skilful at making a salve which kept the hands from getting chapped; and (his family) for generations had made the bleaching of cocoon-silk their business. A stranger heard of it, and proposed to buy the art of the preparation for a hundred ounces of silver. The kindred all came together, and considered the proposal. "We have," said they, "been bleaching cocoon-silk for generations, and have only gained a little money. Now in one morning we can sell to this man our art for a hundred ounces - let him have it." The stranger accordingly got it and went away with it to give counsel to the king of Wu, who was then engaged in hostilities with Yue. The king gave him the command of his fleet, and in the winter he had an engagement with that of Yue, on which he inflicted a great defeat, and was invested with a portion of territory taken from Yue. The keeping the hands from getting chapped was the same in both cases; but in the one case it led to the investiture (of the possessor of the salve), and in the other it had only enabled its owners to continue their bleaching. The difference of result was owing to the different use made of the art. Now you, Sir, had calabashes large enough to hold five piculs; why did you not think of making large bottle-gourds of them, by means of which you could have floated over rivers and lakes, instead of giving yourself the sorrow of finding that they were useless for holding anything. Your mind, my master, would seem to have been closed against all intelligence!'

Huizi said to Zhuangzi, 'I have a large tree, which men call the Ailantus. Its trunk swells out to a large size, but is not fit for a carpenter to apply his line to it; its smaller branches are knotted and crooked, so that the disk and square cannot be used on them. Though planted on the wayside, a builder would not turn his head to look at it. Now your words, Sir, are great, but of no use - all unite in putting them away from them.' Zhuangzi replied, 'Have you never seen a wildcat or a weasel? There it lies, crouching and low, till the wanderer approaches; east and west it leaps about, avoiding neither what is high nor what is low, till it is caught in a trap, or dies in a net. Again there is the Yak, so large that it is like a cloud hanging in the sky. It is large indeed, but it cannot catch mice. You, Sir, have a large tree and are troubled because it is of no use - why do you not plant it in a tract where there is nothing else, or in a wide and barren wild? There you might saunter idly by its side, or in the enjoyment of untroubled ease sleep beneath it. Neither bill nor axe would shorten its existence; there would be nothing to injure it. What is there in its uselessness to cause you distress?'

    ns2:title "Fung Ming Chip  冯明秋" ;
    ns3:calligraphic-formation "Self-Taught"@en ;
    ns3:description """Fung Ming Chip 冯明秋 was born in Guangdong in 1951 and moved to Hong Kong in 1956 where he received only primary education before moving to New Jersey in 1977. His passion for seal carving started in New York in 1975, and this allowed him to broaden his horizons subsequently to calligraphy, studying as a self-taught. He moved to Taiwan in 1986 and finally in 2006 to Hong Kong, where he now lives and works; there he opened his art studio “Sibuguan 四 不管 Four no studio” in an area of the city called Sai Ying Pun.
Fung Ming Chip is a poet, a seal carver and a calligrapher.
His seal production can be divided into three phases: 1) carving stone seals on the basis of traditional models; 2) carving wooden boards; 3) creation of three-dimensional bronze sculptures. At a later time, Fung Ming Chip decided to study and practice calligraphy in order to discover everything that was hidden inside it, seeking its deep meaning and interpreting calligraphy as an artistic medium. In 1996 Fung Ming Chip began experimenting with calligraphy, creating over one hundred new calligraphic “script types” (xiefa 写法). These new “script types” have their own visual language and creative process, breaking with traditional concepts of calligraphy and allowing the viewer to observe calligraphy through a new perspective. The calligraphic production of Fung Ming Chip can be categorized according to three parameters: 1) the degree of legibility of the transcribed text, 2) the use of ink and 3) the spatial arrangement.
Among his many international exhibitions, Fung had a major solo retrospective at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum in 1999. He was artist in residence at Cambridge University, and his work is included in major private and institutional collections around the world, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, White Rabbit Collection, Sydney and Israel Museum, Jerusalem. He has also been active as a painter, photographer, and sculptor. In 2008, he created Les Poemes du Mandarin tableware pattern for Hermes.
The calligraphic production of Fung Ming Chip can be categorized according to three parameters: 1) the degree of legibility of the transcribed text, 2) the use of ink and 3) the spatial arrangement.
1. Legibility: Fung Ming Chip creates artworks in which characters are completely, partially or not recognizable. In the first case, the artist does not detach himself from traditional calligraphy, he traces the characters in full; in the second case characters are partially traced, even if it is still possible to reconstruct them and/or extrapolate their meaning; in the third case the legibility of the characters is compromised, because they are not recognizable, it only remains signs of the characters, approaching a more abstract art.
2. The use of ink: by means of the dilution of ink, the artist creates new calligraphic “script types”. By using brush, water, ink and paper, he tries to experiment with different techniques with the aim of stimulating the viewer mind.
3. The spatial arrangements: Fung Ming Chip breaks down the setting traditional spatial arrangement, exploring new possibilities to expand or reshape the “space and time” elements present in his art.
These three categories are not used always separately, each of them creates new calligraphic “script types” that sometimes are used together in the same work. These continuous experiments demonstrate the intent of Fung Ming Chip to always go further, through his creativity and imagination."""@en ;

    ns3:description "Silvio Ferragina is an Italian calligrapher actively involved in the calligraphic modernization movement. Artist calligrapher of Eastern formation, one of the few Western artists active in the panorama of contemporary experimental Asian calligraphy, with his work in toto reworking of the concept of \"calligraphy\", Silvio Ferragina has emerged on the scene of important exhibitions of calligraphy. In addition to an artistic production of classical inspiration, which uses techniques and styles of traditional Chinese calligraphy, he engages in works of taste and contemporary flavor, which allowed him to return fully within the fold of calligraphic experimentation of today. His research paths explore the world of calligraphic sculpture and investigating the reality of calligraphic live multimedia performance: in his works the Chinese character comes to life in three dimensional structures and the calligraphic sign is transposed into sound, thus achieving a transformation from calligraphic works in \"multidisciplinary musical works\". The work of Silvio Ferragina transcends borders. Among the dimensions of the sign and matter and between languages, Italian and Chinese art, who find in his calligraphies echo of his own spirit and tradition, in a personal and original fusion."@en ;

    ns2:title "Li Qiuqiu (0528)" ;
    ns3:description """The first graffiti writer in Beijing was not Zhang Dali, who is regarded as a street artist rather than a writer, but Li Qiuqiu 李球球, known as 0528, who started his activity in 1996 (see Video section, film Crayon 2012). They argue that Zhang Dali’s work had no impact on the following generation of writers, since he always worked alone without interacting with other artists, and only practiced graffiti for a short period of his career (1995-2005), later moving on to other forms of expression – indeed, he identifies himself as an artist rather than a graffiti writer (film Crayon 2012; Valjakka 2016, p. 361). Li Qiuqiu’s work, instead, had a strong impact on the following generation: he has always interacted with young Beijing writers and, being a pioneer in this field, founded one of the city’s first and most important crews: the Beijing Penzi (Mouna 2017). Regardless of the “rightful” authorship of the first Beijing graffiti, for about ten years Zhang Dali and Li Qiuqiu were unquestionably the only known writers working in the city (Valjakka 2016, p. 361).

Li Qiuqiu is the only one to have really made graffiti history, not only in Beijing, but in the whole of China. He is considered by many to be “the father of Beijing graffiti” and the leader of the movement. For this reason, he earned the nickname of “old boss” (laoda 老 大) (see Video section, film Crayon 2012). Li Qiuqiu was born in 1978, but he started creating graffiti in 1996 (Valjakka 2016, p. 361) when he was only 18. At the beginning he did not write; instead, he depicted simple figures with his spray cans. Around 1999-2000, he started to write his tag 0528, marking his territory around the old city of Beijing (Wang 2016). Actually, when asked when he started making graffiti, Li Qiuqiu answers: “I believe that everything dates back to my elementary school days; I have loved to paint ever since I was a child, and back then I often used chalk and brushes to draw and write on walls” (interview, 2016). In short, he was born to be a writer – one who initially, however, lacked a tag. About this choice, Li Qiuqiu recounts: “0528 is a reference to my birthday [the 28th of May]; I chose this tag in the hope that everyone would remember when I was born!” (interview, 2016). This may sound a bit eccentric, but is reminiscent of the numeric tags of the first writers in New York, although those were linked to the street numbers of their homes. By using his birthday as his personal tag, 0528 would later be emulated by a member of another important Beijing crew the TMM crew, whose tag is 525 as a reference to the writer’s date of birth, the 25th of May. Li Qiuqiu thus seems to have set an example even in the choice of tag, but his influence goes further than this. Li Qiuqiu’s initiation to graffiti art is linked to another of his great passions: skateboarding. Indeed, Li Qiuqiu often went to the Wudaokou neighbourhood to practice with his skateboard together with friends, and this offered him the opportunity to soak up the hip-hop culture (Huang 2016). As we already mentioned, it was thanks to this passion that he met More, and they subsequently came up with the idea to form the BJPZ crew (for More, see ibid.). In 2001, he also founded the Shehui 社会 brand together with other friends, which is still very active today and for which he continues to work, dealing with graphics and brand dissemination. Although Li Qiuqiu never disdained the commercial side of graffiti, the main purpose of his art is strongly linked to the old school and the wish to bomb the city with his tags and pieces as an act of denunciation and rebellion, even though his works are actually neither seditious nor subversive. More than 10 years ago, 0528 refused to create Olympics themed graffiti in the 798 Art District, even though commissioned by the government. This was because, as he says, he wanted to feel free to do whatever he wanted, wherever he wanted, never allowing things to be imposed from above (film Crayon 2012). Since he sees himself as a free spirit, his “contacts” with the police have not been at all rare (Wang 2016). 

As he recalls, the first encounter was during high school, when he was making graffiti near the Temple of Heaven, one of the city’s renowned monuments. The policemen confiscated his ID card, which his father demanded back the next day, provided Li Qiuqiu restored the wall to its original condition before his intervention. His worst experience was in 2010, in Amsterdam, where painting on walls is a crime. He was arrested, held in custody for 24 hours and had to pay a fine of 370 euro to get out of prison, an exorbitant amount for his means! The funniest anecdote happened in 2006 in Tianjin, a big city close to Beijing. On that occasion, the police approached him while he was making graffiti on a government building wall – the Municipality – which was considered utterly unacceptable. They took him to the police station, but here one of the policemen declared he knew and liked his art. He mentioned to his colleagues that the person they had detained was an artist and, through his intervention, Li Qiuqiu was released after 24 hours of custody without even having to pay a fine (film Crayon 2012). These “encounters” with the police were frequent also for the other crew mem-bers. For example, More said that he and other writers happened to be picked up by policemen quite regularly because they mostly bomb at night. For him, the most troubling experience happened while creating graffiti in Shanxi, a region near the municipality of Beijing, where he had to pay a 300 yuan fine (around 40 euro) to be released (ibid.). Zak, on the other hand, was first detained by the police when he was writing his tag with a marker on an underground carriage door at the Andingmen station in Beijing. As he explains, this was the first of a long series of arrests, and every time the police forced him to cover up his writings. From his own experience, he also learned that during festivities and major city events, detention is more likely because police checks are more frequent (ibid.). Unlike Europe, China has no specific law regulating vandalism on walls, so writers are generally tolerated, and punishments are minimal – usually small fines or an order to cover up their work – although this does not mean going unnoticed by the police. However, as experienced by Li Qiuqiu in Amsterdam, things are very different in the West! 

Besides being considered the father of Beijing graffiti, Li Qiuqiu is certainly a pioneer of the development of a “Chinese style”. He was arguably the first to experiment with the use of Chinese characters in his graffiti, or at least his are the first of which we have photographic evidence. 

In conclusion, we can consider Li Qiuqiu as a true pioneer of graffiti art in China and the creator of a Chinese style in which everything can be traced back to its particular authorship, from bombing to elaborate pieces, from simple writing to figurative and decorative elements (which seem to be veering increasingly towards street art). Li Qiuqiu is, in fact, one of the few who managed to move from emulating western styles and stylistic features to creating something new and original that is recognisably Chinese: a true benchmark for the development of graffiti throughout China."""@en ;

    ns3:description """Echo Morgan is the English name of Xie Rong 谢蓉, a Chinese artist born in Chengdu in 1983 and living in London. She moved to UK when she was 19. Echo Morgan works with the stereotypes of “Chineseness” and femininity to revolutionize them. Echo Morgan studied at the High School of the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute before moving to London where she gained a BA in Graphic Design at Central Saint Martins and an MA in Fine Art at the Royal College of Art. Her work has featured in a debut exhibition “Home家” at the Galerie Huit of Hong Kong, and a group show, Engender, at Alaska Projects, Sydney (both 2017). Her performance works have been seen in China, Sweden and the UK. In her work, she takes on the role of director, performer, narrator, and filmmaker. She collects and collages encounters, voices, texts, images, and objects from my culture roots in China and her daily life in UK. Through the mediums of performance and painting, she explores the intrinsic and complex relationship between violence, beauty, and vulnerability, re-examining how these antipodal constructs impact ideas of the “self” and the body. Her narrative is rooted with her family history, she explores her individual memory that is deeply embodied with China’s complex society – one that had undergone a series of philosophical, ideological and political transformations. She often invites viewers to participate, drawing strength from the audiences’ emotional vulnerability and feelings of uneasiness to complete the performance. Her emotions become entwined with the audiences’, creating a symbiotic relationship based on control and power. Juxtaposing English narration with Chinese traditional songs, she plays with her identity and difficult childhood. She explores the territory between gesture and stillness, between her past and present, between abstract mark making and personal story telling and between public space and intimate privacy. 
Morgan wrote lyrics about her on her skin using red lipstick, black Chinese ink, jasmine tea-based white “ink”, and her own mother’s milk after giving birth to her second child. She played with chinoiserie tropes, painting her naked body to look like blue-and-white porcelain, and then inviting the audience to violently wash away her motifs by throwing water-filled balloons at her. Echo Morgan narrates her childhood, family, marriage, and motherhood experiences, as well as those of her ancestors.  In Echo Morgan’s works her own body, her hair, even her breast milk, become a language; she is writing a woman’s story of suffering with a subtext of strength and courage. She says: “I do really respect the power and strength of women, but I think in my work you see a lot of fragility. And that is how I feel, as a daughter, as a wife, as a mother”. 
Xie Rong has presented performances in gallery spaces, museums and festivals in the UK, France, China, Sweden, Egypt, Germany, Switzerland Australia and Korea. In 2021, the Museum of Far Eastern Art (Israel) dedicated a solo-exhibition to her performance archive. """@en ;

    ns3:calligraphic-formation "Academic"@en ;
    ns3:description """Pu Lieping was born in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, in 1959. His home life changed radically when the Cultural Revolution got under way. In 1967, at the age of eight, he had the distressing experience of seeing his father harassed by the Red Guards and forced to wear a dunce's cap. In 1980 he began taking private calligraphy lessons from Bai Yunshu, a leading local calligrapher and scholar. The following year, at the age of just twenty-two, Pu Lieping was rated among the ten best calligraphers in the province in an open competition. As his role models he chose two past calligraphers whose example he felt would help him find his own style: Mi Fu (1051-1107) and Huaisu (725-785). Gu Gan's book "The Fromation of Modern Calligraphy" (1986) had a notable influence on him. He wanted to find a way to employ calligraphic forms to express both a sense of China's great heritage and its cultural essence in a contemporary context, although the more he experimented within the frame of Modernism, the more he came to realize that using readable characters was constraining his own creativity. Throughout the decade, Pu Lieping experimented with what he defined as the creation of "Visual Music". He was still using readable characters, but their shape and structure were now more distorted than a few years earlier, capturing a sense of movement and harmony he assimilated with that of music. In 2000 he developped a new technique, using calligraphic brushstrokes to give shape to his compositions.

Pu Leping describes himself as a "Chinese character artist, critic and designer".  He is currently Director of the “Research Centre for Chinese Character Ceramic Art” in Changnan, Jingdezhen and of the “Beida Peiwen Chinese Character Art Research Centre” (Beida Peiwen hanzi yishu yanjiu zhongxin 北大培文汉字艺术研究中心) in Beijing which he founded in 2017. In 1999, he curated the exhibition “Bashu Point Soldiers: 99 Retrospective Exhibition of Modern Chinese Calligraphy at the End of the 20th Century in Chengdu” (Bashu dian bing: 99 Chengdu 20 shijimo Zhongguo xiandai shufa huigu zhan (巴蜀点兵：99 成都 20 世纪末中国现代书法回顾展) held in Chengdu. In 2002, he took part in the exhibition “Amazing Strokes: The Art of Modern Chinese Calligraphy” (Jingren zhi bi: xiandai Zhongguo shufa yishu 惊人之笔：现代中国书法艺术) at the British Museum in the UK and, together with Gu Gan, proposed the concept of “Chinese Character Art” (hanzi yishu 汉字艺术) (see infra). In 2004, he established the first teaching of character art at the Peking University Resource College of Fine Arts, and demonstrated and applied the concept of 'Chinese Character Art' in various aspects of education, theory, and practice. In 2009, he started to plan the future global promotion of Chinese Character Art. In 2011, he founded the Jingdezhen Changnan Chinese Character Ceramic Art Research Centre in Jingdezhen. He is the author of texts such as “A Brief History of Modern Chinese Calligraphy to the Art of Chinese Characters 1985-2016” (1985 – 2016 Zhongguo xiandai shufa dao hanzi yishu jian shi 1985-2016 中国现代书法到汉字艺术简史); a monograph on the “Evaluation of Modern Calligraphy” (Xiandai shufa jianshang 现代书法鉴赏) and founder of the journal “Art of Chinese Characters” (Hanzi yishu 汉字艺术)."""@en ;

    ns3:description """The calligraphy masterpiece "Lanting Xu 兰亭序" (Orchid Pavilion Preface) was created by Wang Xizhi at the party he organized on the third day of the third month on the Chinese calendar in 353 at the Orchid Pavilion (Lanting 兰亭), at Kuaiji Mountain near today's Shaoxing city in east China's Zhejiang Province. A group of 41 guests gathered for the party, including Wang's younger son, Wang Xianzhi, also a renowned scholar and calligrapher. Everyone was in high spirits because of the beautiful, sunny weather - a rare occurrence for that time of year in the area. As well as chatting about friendships and state affairs, the group held a kind of poem-composing contest. The 41 partygoers sat along the bank of a winding, slow-flowing streamlet, while servants placed goblets of wine on the water's surface and let them float downstream. If a goblet stopped in front of one of the group, they were required to compose a poem on the spot. If they failed, they had to down three goblets of wine as a forfeit. By the end of the day, 11 scholars had each produced two poems, 15 had each composed one poem and the other 16 - including Wang's younger son - who had failed to come up with a poem had knocked back the wine. Then, Wang was asked to write a preface for the 37 poems composed at the Orchid Pavilion. In high spirits, he immediately penned the famous "Lanting Xu" off-the-cuff, in 28 lines and 324 Chinese characters. 
"""@en ;
    ns3:trascription-or-translation """It is the ninth year of Emperor Mu of Jin's Yonghe era 
The year of the Yin Water Ox,
At the beginning of the third lunar month,
We are all gathered at the orchid pavilion in Shanyin County, Guiji Commandery,
For the Spring Purification Festival.
All of the prominent people have arrived,
From old to young.
This is an area of high mountains and lofty peaks,
With an exuberant growth of trees and bamboos,
It also has clear rushing water,
Reflecting the sunlight as it flows past either side of the pavilion.
The guests are seated side by side to play the drinking game where a wine cup is floated down the stream and the first person sitting in front of the cup when it stops must drink.
Although we lack the boisterousness of a live orchestra,
With a cup of wine here and a reciting of poetry there, it is sufficient to allow for a pleasant exchange of cordial conversations.
Today, the sky is bright and the air is clear,
With a gentle breeze that is blowing freely. When looking up, one can see the vastness of the heavens,
And when looking down, one can observe the abundance of things. The contentment of allowing one’s eyes to wander,
Is enough to reach the heights of delight for the sight and sound. What a joy.
Now all people live in this world together,
Some will take all of their aspirations, and share them in private with a friend;
Still others will abandon themselves to reckless pursuits.
Even though everyone makes different choices in life, some thoughtful and some rash,
When a person meets with joy, he will temporarily be pleased,
And will feel content, but he is not mindful that old age will soon overtake him.
Wait until that person becomes weary, or has a change of heart about something,
And will thus be filled with regrets.
The happiness of the past, in the blink of an eye,
Will have already become a distant memory, and this cannot but cause one to sigh;
In any case, the length of a man’s life is determined by the Creator, and we will all turn to dust in the end.
The ancients have said, "Birth and Death are both momentous occasions."
Isn’t that sad!
Every time I consider the reasons for why the people of old had regrets,
I am always moved to sadness by their writings,
And I can not explain why I am saddened.
I most certainly know that it is false and absurd to treat life and death as one and the same,
And it is equally absurd to think of dying at an old age as being the same as dying at a young age.
When future generations look back to my time, it will probably be similar to how I now think of the past.
What a shame! Therefore, when I list out the people that were here,
And record their musings, even though times and circumstances will change,
As for the things that we regret, they are the same.
For the people who read this in future generations, perhaps you will likewise be moved by these words."""@en,

歲在癸丑，
暮春之初，	
會于會稽山陰之蘭亭，

此地有崇山峻領，
茂林修竹，
又有清流激湍，
映帶左右。	
引以為流觴曲水，列坐其次；	
雖無絲竹管弦之盛，
一觴一詠，亦足以暢敘幽情。	
是日也，天朗氣清，
惠風和暢，仰觀宇宙之大，	
俯察品類之盛，所以遊目騁懷，
足以極視聽之娛，信可樂也。

或取諸懷抱，晤言一室之內；
或因寄所托，放浪形骸之外。	
雖趣舍萬殊，靜躁不同，	
當其欣于所遇，暫得于己，	
快然自足，不知老之將至。	
及其所之既倦，情隨事遷，	
感慨係之矣。	
向之所欣，俛仰之間，	
已為陳迹，猶不能不以之興懷；	
况修短隨化，終期于盡。	
古人云﹕「死生亦大矣。」
豈不痛哉！	
每攬昔人興感之由，	
若合一契，未嘗不臨文嗟悼，	
不能喻之于懷。	
固知一死生為虛誕，
齊彭殤為妄作。

    ns3:description """Shao Yan 邵岩 is a Chinese calligrapher born in 1962 in Wendeng, Shandong Province (China). At the age of six, he started studying and practising traditional calligraphy under the aegis of his father with the intention of surpassing the ancient calligraphy masters. When he realised that he would not succeed through mere imitation of the great masters, he felt it was time to move away from tradition and embrace new opportunities and artistic ways to show his identity and uniqueness. He studied Fine Arts at Shandong Laiyang University in 1981 and at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1990. In 1991 he moved to Beijing where he currently lives. Recently, he holds many important positions including vice-President of the Calligraphy Research Institute of the Jiangsu Academy of Fine Arts and Researcher at the National Painting Academy of China. Shao Yan took part in numerous exhibitions and won several awards like the first prize in the National Exhibition of young and middle-aged calligraphers (Quanguo zhongqingnian shufa zhuankezhan 全国中青年书法篆刻展) both in 1995 and 1997.
Shao Yan's artistic production, that lies between tradition and modernity, can be divided in three different periods: in the first period (1985 - 1995) the artist executed works 'with few characters' inspired by modern Japanese calligraphy (see "Bright Snow", Qing xue 晴雪). Influenced by Western abstract painting, he also started breaking down characters until they become unreadable, but he 'pictorially' reproduced their meaning that the observer can grasp through visual perception (see "Surrounding", Wei 圍 / 围); in the second period (1995 - 2005) the artist continued to carry out artworks “with a few characters” (see "Army", Jun 军) but also experimented  with calligraphy “with several characters” (“Peach blossoms fall in a chaotic rain of red dust”, Taohua luanluo hongchengyu 桃花乱落红尘雨). In addition, he introduced the technique of ink “washed” in water (shui de "chongxi" 水的 "冲洗") (see “Sea”, Hai 海 and “Flying Good Luck”, Fei lai hao yun 飞来好运); finally, in the third period (2006 - ongoing), he has begun to use a syringe with a small ink reservoir or more syringes instead of the brush (see “The Thirty-Six Stratagems of using ink”, Mofa sanshiliuji 墨法三十六计 and “Chaos”, Hundun 混沌) and has also executed works that carry meanings related to important social issues.
In recent years, Shao Yan has staged several calligraphy performances using the syringe to squirt ink (see the performance “Ink shooting”, Shemo 射墨) and has begun to realize calligraphy on Chinese ceramics and porcelain, using different techniques, tools and styles (see “Watching the sea and Listening to the Waves”, Guan hai ting tao 观海听涛; “Best Wishes”, Ruyi 如意 and “Ceramic ink shooting", Shemo ciping  射墨瓷瓶).

The most active period of the crew lasted until 2010 when most of the crew members, who were art academies students, graduated from university and "the competitive everyday life in Beijing has forced the members to focus on their daily jobs in order to support their families" (Valiakka 2016, 361). From 2006 to 2009, the Kwanyin Clan mainly worked in Beijing, even if the crew also created some pieces in Langfang (Hubei), Chongqing, Tianjin, Guilin, Wuhan, and Shenzhen. Then, from 2009, each member of the crew started to work more individually: Jer, for example, has been mainly active in Wuhan, Keno Tang has focused on the embellishment of the hutong in Beijing (especially from 2011), and EricTin has concentrated his attention on design works. Nevertheless, they occasionally continue to work together, as it happened in 2016, when they took part in the most important exhibition on street art held in China in the last decade, entitled "Street Art, a Global View". In addition to this fundamental exhibition, from 2007 to 2009 the crew took part in the most important Chinese graffiti exhibitions and competitions: "China’s First Graffiti Exhibition" (Beijing, 20007), "Re-dressed Vehicles Exposition" (Beijing, 2007), "Motor Trend Magazine Graffiti Exhibition" (Beijing, 2007), "798 Art District Graffiti Festival" (Beijing, 2007), "The Clash Show New Design Exhibition" (Beijing, 2007), "The Great Way of Graffiti Cultural Festival" (Beijing, 2008), "Beijing Happy Valley Hip-Hop Festival" (Beijing, 2008), "China International Cartoon & Game Expo" (CCG EXPO), "Shijingshan Cultural Festival Graffiti Show" (Beijing, 2008), "The 3rd China Beijing International Cultural & Creative Industry Expo", "The 2nd Graffiti Art Exhibition" (Beijing, 2008), the "Wall Lord Graffiti Battle"(Wuhan, 2009), the "Action for Seed Graffiti Jam" (Shenzhen, 2009), etc.
Their first documented mural and their first recorded piece were made in December 2006. From that moment onward they created more than one hundred graffiti works and lots of graphic/digital design works (advertising posters, logos, books and CDs covers, prints on T-shirts, etc.). As usual for Chinese graffiti writers, the Kwanyin Clan engaged frequent collaborations with Chinese and foreign brands, especially with sports brands (Kappa, Lotto, Nike), electronic brands (Nokia, DELL, HP), and private clubs (VICS, Master Club, KTV, Gaga club, Club underground, Golf club, etc.). In these cases, their graffiti works were usually made on removable panels (once even on paper boxes, for the iMART in 2008) or indoor walls (of clubs or shops) using Latin letters and Old school Euro-Americans styles.
The Kwanyin Clan also collaborated with the Chinese government for the beautification of the metropolitan environment or to promote the image of a prosperous country in international competitions, as it happened in 2008 for the Beijing Olympics Games.
In addition to these legal activities for private companies and public institutions, the Kwanyin Clan was also involved in illegal bombing on the streets, especially in the 798 Art District and in Sanlitun in the city of Beijing. Their first documented bombing activity took place in April 2007 in the 798 Art District. This kind of activity usually consists of tagging up and/or throw-ups made in bubble letters filled with one or maximum two colours.
Because of their relevance in the Beijing graffiti panorama, the Kwanyin Clan is also the author of numerous murals and pieces in spray painting made on the most important halls of fame in Beijing: i) in the 798 Art District, ii) in the neighborhood of the Today Art Museum, and iii) near the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, along a street that they named "The Kwanyin Street" (Guanyin Jie 观音街) because of the high number of pieces they made there.
Like most of the Chinese crews, the primary aim of their art is the beautification of urban space (not rebellion), and self-expression. The majority of their unauthorized graffiti are apolitical or they are created to support the establishment and not to criticise it. Their attitude towards commissioned and paid graffiti is extremely positive and, in fact, they usually engage collaborations with foreign and domestic brands to promote their commercial campaigns. In their art (as in most of Chinese local creators), the paradox of turning an artistic language (graffiti art) that is expression of subcultures into mainstream, or even a commercial product, is evident.
Examining the crew artistic production, it is possible to distinguish a good number of oeuvres characterised by the use of both Chinese and Western elements and/or techniques, exploring the fusion of graffiti art with China traditional aesthetics. With the exception of bombing activity and most of their commercial works, the use of Chinese characters together with Latin letters is a leitmotiv in their artistic production from their first mural onwards. From the beginning of their activity, Chinese characters are usually used for writing Chinese tags (especially in the forms of Guan or Guanyin characters), and from 2008 they have experimented with the use of Chinese characters instead of Latin letters in the creation of very elaborate charactering pieces. Another characteristic of their works is the presence of other visual elements that are easily recognisable as Chinese (such as pandas, dragons, bamboo and rocks, lotus flowers, pagodas, red fishes, Taoist deities, etc.), usually painted in form of comic puppet.
But, in addition to the use of Chinese writing and Chinese elements (common to other Chinese crews too), the peculiarity of the Kwanyin Clan is that in some particular works they also try to merge Euro-American graffiti practice with the ancient traditional arts of the Chinese literati (calligraphy, poetry, painting, and seal carving) or with uncommon media, for example ceramics, that are traditionally Chinese and highly appreciated by the Chinese literati.
The crew’s main aim is the development of a notion of Chineseness in contemporary graffiti, as they have repeatedly stated and as their name dedicated to the Chinese "Goddess of Mercy" (Guanyin) alludes.
The name of the crew is significant because it clearly reveals the deep meaning of their art: "Kwan-yin" explicitly refers to the "Bodhisattva Guanyin" (Guanyin Pusa 观音菩萨), one of the most popular and well known deity in China. The crew itself points out that the story of the Bodhisattva was fundamental for the choice of their name: Guanyin, in fact, was introduced into China via the Silk Road and was initially presented in a male form, but when Buddhism rooted in China, the Bodhisattva was sinicized and subsequently transformed into a Chinese female form, which later became extremely popular all over the country. Kwanyin Clan’s artistic aim is to present graffiti art in China as an alter ego of the Bodhisattva Guanyin: as it had happened for Guanyin, graffiti art came from abroad, but if it wants to become popular in China it has to sinicize its forms, undergoing deity own metamorphosis.
Their aim "is committed to the dissemination and development of graffiti art in China" in order to "explore the fusion of graffiti art with Chinese culture". For that reason, their art is usually defined "Chinese Style Graffiti" (Zhongguo tese de tuya yishu 中国特色的涂鸦艺术) because it blends together the style of Western graffiti and the traditional Chinese aesthetics.
They usually use Chinese language to write their tags (especially in the forms of "Guan" 观 [觀] or "Guanyin" 观音 [觀音] characters) as well as to create elaborate charactering pieces, like for example in Shirupozhu 势如破竹 (With Irresistible Force, 2008), and Shengongyijiang 神工意匠 (Ars Divina, 2010). Also the insertion of visual elements that are easily recognizable as Chinese is a constant in the Kwanyin Clan’s works: pandas, dragons, bamboo and rocks, lotus flowers, pagodas, red fishes, Taoist deities, ping pong, mahjong, fans, etc. are extremely common in their oeuvres. In addition to the use of Chinese writing and Chinese visual cultural elements, the Kwanyin Clan also tried to merge Euro-American graffiti practice with Chinese traditional aesthetics and, in particular, with the ancient traditional arts of the Chinese literati (calligraphy, poetry and painting). This is a distinguishable feature of their art and perhaps one of the best interpretation of the notion of "Chineseness" in Chinese graffiti.
In their artworks, in fact, i) the use of calligraphic inscriptions is a recurring element; ii) the reference to Chinese classical poetry and "sanjue" (三绝) notion (the reference to the Chinese indissoluble artistic triad of "poetry, calligraphy and painting" (shi shu hua 诗书画) that from the eighth century onward, in China have been known as the "three perfections", and they have been intimately connected in the minds of the "Chinese literati" (wen ren 文人), representing the basis of traditional Chinese culture (Sullivan 1974, 7) is not rare (in artworks like Shirupozhu, Shengongyijiang, and New Style); and iii) in addition to landscape painting, other Chinese traditional art forms has been reinterpreted, such as bamboo painting and archaic bronze vessels in New Style, bamboo and rocks painting in Bamboo, ceramics in Blue and white porcelain (2009-2010) and in Artwork made for the exhibition "Street Art, a Global View" (2016), paper-cutting in Passage of time, and jade disks carving in Situanheqi 四团和气 (Four-cluster harmony, 2010).
For them, the "sinicization" process of graffiti art means not only the use of Chinese language and other Chinese visual elements but also drawing from China’s classical tradition: this is their innovative notion of "Chineseness"."""@en ;

    ns3:description """Zhang Qiang is an artistic revolutionary with strongly conservative credentials. He has a deep understanding of traditional Chinese painting and calligraphy, and a thorough knowledge of the aesthetic theories that underpin them. He is also a leading theorist of the Avant-Garde movement in calligraphy and the founder of "traceology", an entirely new genre that is centred on enlisting the aid of a female partner in creating each work.
He was born in 1962 and brought up in Shandong. His father was the head of a huge agricultural commune comprising some 30,000 people and his mother was in charge of its 'women's affairs'. He went to the Taian Teacher's Training College, near Mount Tai, and three years later, while teaching at the middle school in his home town of Feicheng, he began to take a serious interest in Chinese art. The Shandong Arts Institute in Jinan appointed him to its staff as a lecturer and in 1993 he was made director of the newly created Office of Fine Arts Studies. He believed that including meaningful text in calligraphy would provide great scope for developing it as a modern art form. In 1993 he started experimenting with the help of female partners. He started with a student of Chinese painting who wrote Avant-Garde poetry characterized by disjunctions of time and place. As she read her poems aloud, Zhang Qian would try to write down the words in an abstract way. One night he got the woman to move his paper while he was writing down on it the words she was reciting. Then a flash of inspiration made him turn his head away so that he could not see his partner while he was writing, although she could still see his hand moving the brush. This time the results amazed him. All of the sudden, he had succeeding in freeing himself from all the restrictions imposed by the conventional composition of characters. In 1995 he started working with other creative young women. The sentences he wrote out were usually fairly mundane thoughts that happened to be running through his mind, rather than the words of the great Chinese poets or any of the poems he himself writes in classical style. Zhang Qian has described and analysed the whole traceology project in a book entitled "Trace Aesthetics: Cultural Cross-overs through Art" (2002). In it he says that during the project he felt as if he was using his brush to construct a building while his partner was exerting an elemental force, like an earthquake, to destroy the whole structure. For him, the shattered traces recall the moods of the women with whom he worked. Others, however, feel that they are like a Chinese version of the Rorschach ink-blot tests, with viewers projecting their own preoccupations on to what they see before them. In 1998 he set about creating a different form of traceology. Having already turned his calligraphy from a scholarly artistic pursuit into an exploration of the use of space in two dimensions, he wanted to experiment with more independent visual forms in three dimensions. He focused on the two most basic three-dimensional forms: the cube and the sphere. He believes that this forms lie at the heart of Western art and so can act as a bridge linking East and West. His installation works consist of long strips of paper on to which his female partner places plastic balls and cubes after he has painted them. Artist and assistant work on one section of the paper before unfolding the next. The woman decides whether she will lay the objects on the paper one by one as each becomes ready, or wait and position them all at once. Women are even more central to Zhang Qiang's art when their own bodies become the medium on which he paints. He was worked in this way with young Chinese women wearing black one-piece swimsuits, in order to create harmony between their black costumes, their black hair and the ink he is applying to their exposed flesh. He has also done a series of works featuring women in white.
Zhang Qiang has adopted a brave artistic approach to stimulating debate about perceptions of calligraphy and their cultural implications for Chinese society. One of his great strengths in doing so is that no one can accuse him of simply waving his brush about like a child. He is a scholar and a professor, widely respected for his knowledge of the history and theory of both Chinese and Western Art."""@en ;

    ns3:description """Wang Dongling (b. 1945) is Full Professor of calligraphy at the China Academy of Art  (Zhongguo  meishu xueyuan 中国美术学院), President of the Modern Calligraphy Research Center of China Academy of Art (Zhongguo meishu xueyuan xiandai shufa yanjiu zhongxin 中国美术学院现代书法研究中心), Chairman of Hangzhou Calligraphers Association (Hangzhou shi shufajia xiehui 杭州市书法家协会) and President of Lanting Calligraphy Society (Lanting shufa shehui (兰亭书法社会).
Wang studied painting in the Department of Fine Arts at the Teachers' College in Nanjing, the capital of his home province before the closure of the institute in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. After that, Wang worked at the cultural and educational office to promote mass education through art. 
Wang Dongling graduated from the first calligraphy graduate class of Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (now China Academy of Art) in 1981 with a Master of Arts and stayed at the school to teach. In 1989, he went to the University of Minnesota to teach Chinese calligraphy for four years, and was a visiting professor at the school and the University of California (Santa Cruz). In 1994, he returned to teach at the China Academy of Art.

[...]
At the beginning, he was criticized as a feudal, capitalist, and revisionist-minded artist, for his classical-style calligraphy with classical Chinese poem. But he escaped any punishment as a young man and capable of writing big-characters posters. Wang considers the Cultural Revolution as an exposure to new ideas. Wang believes that his experience of writing manifestos in the heat of the Cultural Revolution released him from the tight discipline imposed in calligraphy classes at college. For the first time, he felt a real sense of artistic freedom. The sense of wanton destruction of all forms of traditional art that occurred during the Cultural Revolution provided a means by which Wang's eyes were opened even more to the beauty of calligraphy.
In the following years, after the propaganda work, he joined the group of students of Lin Sanzhi, one of the greatest calligraphers of modern China. At the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, he returned to his college to collect his degree and decide to attend the Zhejiang Academy of Art (now the National Academy of Art) to pursue a career as a calligrapher. He intended to follow the teachings of Lu Weizhao (1899-1980), as Wang felt that Lu's handwriting "gripped you because it had a unique combination of brushwork and structure that was uplifting to all who saw it" (Barrass). His actual teacher was Sha Menghai who gave him great inner strength through the use of bold and energetic brushstrokes. 
Lin Sanzhi, Lu Weizhao and Sha Menghai represent three different perspectives on the art of calligraphy for Wang. From these artists, Wang learned not only the classical technique and the construction of individual characters, but also to break free from the mould of traditional calligraphy by combining a new form full of movement. Wang's belief is that the essence of the art is the projection of the personality of the artist. 
China began to open up in the early 1980s and new Western art concepts began to have a strong influence in China. According to Wang, the time had come, albeit belatedly, for China to embark on the process of revitalizing calligraphy. There was no reason to fear the influence of foreign art, as it could easily be absorbed within an art form that would always retain its Chinese essence.
"As the 1980s progressed, Wang began to feel that he had a mission to try to revitalize the art of calligraphy. He knew of recent developments in the work of the Modernist school, who held a major exhibition in Beijing in 1985, but what they were doing was not to his taste. He therefore started to explore different avenues. As he explains in his book The Art of Calligraphy (1986), he believed above all that the revival of calligraphy depended on its becoming more painterly (Barrass)."
Two major exhibitions of Wang's works were organized in 1987 and 1988, in Hangzhou and then in Beijing. Many of the exhibits demonstrated his traditional calligraphy skills, but others were more "modernist" in form, such as his calligraphy done on newspapers or as part of a collage.
Wang started to produce large-scale works such as Ru, Dao, Fo 儒道佛 ("Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism"), which represents the three main roots of Chinese culture and 'View from Heaven' 泰山成砥砺，黄河为裳带, ten huge characters in bold cursive script on four panels, the largest piece of calligraphy ever executed in China. Wang wanted to demonstrate that by placing words on paper in a painterly way one could greatly enhance thier impact. 
In the late 1980s and early 1990s Wang's art will be greatly influenced by the different cultural environments he experienced in the United States and Japan. The former led his style to become more open and international; the latter served as a reminder to him that his art would only succeed if it remained firmly rooted in Chinese culture and the traditions of Chinese brushwork.

Wang discovered the power Western paintings conveyed through composition, line and colour. Western art changed Wang's approach to his own work. He started to emphasize the links between abstract art and Chinese calligraphy.
In Wang Dongling's art, the main element that needs to be experimented to refresh Chinese art is the line. In Wang's eyes the line can contribute to the development of a new international genre of calligraphy. As the main representative of the modernist calligraphers, his theis is that modern calligraphy is still calligraphy (cf. Iezzi chap. 3.2.1), and is presented as a push towards a development of calligraphy defined by himself as a "healthy development" (现代书法的健康发展) (Iezzi 2014: 58-59). He mainly follows the abstract spatial orientation  within the modernist current (Iezzi 2014: 16)

Whilst in the United Stated (March 1989-December 1992), Wang mounted several solo exhibitions of his work. He createrd several innovative collages that integrated Western images with Chinese characters to form a composition expressing a simple concept. One example of it is the  collage containing a photograph of the legendary Martha Graham dancing.
On his return to China in 1992, Wang went to Beijing to work with the Chinese Calligraphers' Association. In Beijing and on a sabbatical  in Japans he devoted much of his time to enhance his technique studying the ancient masters.  
Returned as a calligraphy professor at the Hangzhou Academy in 1995, Wang demonstrates his skills and those of his students in numerous exhibitions. In the following years Wang worked outside of the limits of traditiion of find ways to expressing his own feelings.
In the late 1990s,  Wang again began to produce very large pieces of calligraphy. Wang holds a deep attraction in Daoism, one of the strands of ancient Chinese philosophy. Wang is famous for his unique style, called Chaos Script (luanshu 乱书) with powerful brushwork of black ink. By varying the density of the ink and the speed of his brushstrokes with the strokes weaving in and out of one another, he is able to create characters that give an impression of depth. In America he is better known than any modernist calligrapher still residing in China. Chaos Script is a new artistic expression conveying Chinese calligraphy entering the field of contemporary art. This script strictly abides by the writing rules of cursive script, but the extension has become a vivid trace of writing in the global context of contemporary art. It expresses the echoing of abstract expressionism, but still shows the unique and charming wisdom and superb skills of a calligrapher from the oriental tradition.
In the last two decades Wang continues to be a prolific calligrapher.  Wang's work continues to span the full range of artistic expression, from the Grand Tradition and its Neo-Classical variants, through Modernist styles where characters are presented in new forms or as part of collages of Eastern and Western art, to the innovativeness of the Avant-Garde and new technologies such as the augmented reality (AR). Wang has unquestionably made a major contribution to revitalizing Chinese calligraphy and creating an art that can be appreciated by viewers all over the world.
